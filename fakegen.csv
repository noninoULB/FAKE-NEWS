10;Mirrors sick of all of your Robert De Niro impressions;Mirrors across America have claimed, not unreasonably, that they are all sick of your Robert De Niro Impressions.Mirror, Cindy Sheen, said 'Honestly, if Gary asks me one more time if I am talking to him, I won't be happy. Gary, we know you are the only one here, but that is because you are self-isolating. To be honest, there has only been one time in the past eight years when you haven't been talking to me, and that was when you brought that poor woman back here. She looked around the flat once, said she needed to use the bathroom, and left out of the window.

11;Man's Week Goes According To Plan;With all the frantic uncertainty surrounding the outbreak of the deadly Coronavirus relentlessly hounding us in our daily lives, there was some respite for one man this week, when his time went more-or-less according to plan.Moys Kenwood, 56, was laid off from his job at a local school, in a belated attempt to contain the spread of the dastardly virus, and immediately set about planning-out his leisuretime.First on his list, was playing endless games with his two children: hide and seek, riding bikes, 'wrestling with dad', drawing, painting, coloring, 'Construction Site' with diggers, steamroller, tractor, and lorries loading sand, and, when they were fed up of those, lolling in front of the TV.When the kids had fallen asleep, and were 'recharging their batteries', he read Friedrich Engels 'The Condition of the Working Class in England', and listened to music, including The Durutti Column, The Fall, Dominique A, the Gang Of Four, A Certain Ratio and Julio Iglesias.His meals arrived on schedule, and he retired to bed at his regular time of 10pm, sleeping until 6am, or shortly thereafter, as is normal.Everything went swimmingly, and nothing happened to upset his plans.But, still, at the back of his mind, something was not quite right.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The highly professional thieves managed to take the 9,000 rolls of TP in just under 55 seconds.Officer Timothy Timmons with the MPD said that he has never seen thieves move that fast. He pointed out that the three thieves who were identified as being Swiss were all wearing Michael Jordan Jumpin’ Jumpball Footwear, which retails for $297 a pair.SIDENOTE: Officer Timmons said that the reason he figured that the thieves were Swiss was because one dropped a Swiss army knife and on the surveillance video another one of the thieves could be heard yodeling an old Swiss Alps Mountain wedding song.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;Many Grocery Stores Are Hiring Security Guards Just For Their Toilet Paper Aisles;CHEYENNE, Wyoming - MTV is reporting that many grocery store chains are now having to hire extra security guards.They note that due to the extreme shortage of toilet paper they are seeing more and more incidents of violence among the shoppers.One individual who was shopping at a Krogers was seen biting the elbow of an elderly woman who had reached for the same TP package that he was reaching for.Luckily for the woman a good samaritan who witnessed the incident was able to pry open the man’s jaw and remove the elderly woman’s elbow out of his frothing mouth.Another shopper who described herself as a King Trump supporter was seen opening a package of Northern TP and literally stuffing two rolls inside her granny panties.A store clerk saw her and reported her to the security guard who told her to take them out of her crotch region.She refused. He fired a warning shot up in the air and the woman got so scared that she took the two rolls out of her panties, tossed them on the floor, and took off running towards the frozen food section.She was tackled by a merchant who was delivering bread and held until the security guard could take her into custody.He put her in handcuffs and as she was being led away she began shouting that Trump is the most handsome and sexiest president she has ever seen and that she wants to have his baby.The guard told her to shut the eff up or he would have to shoot her in the foot.IN OTHER NEWS – Manhattan is cancelling this year’s annual Bring Your Pet To Work Day.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;Dairy Queen Makes A Major Announcement Regarding The C-19;MINNEAPOLIS – According to The Minneapolis Daily Embellisher, the DQ headquarters has just implemented a new corporate policy.DQ Senior Executive Vice-Chairman Angus P. Butterhouse has informed the public that, effective immediately, all of the DQ cooks will now be wearing Haz-Mat suits.Butterhouse said that, with the DQ shares taking a hell of a nosedive, his company cannot afford to lose anymore customers. He added that he also fears that he will have to put his secondary yacht up on the market.A reporter for the Daily Embellisher asked one DQ cook, identified as Stavros Queenquist, what he thought about having to wear a Haz-Mat suit.He just shrugged his shoulders, and said that he did not really mind wearing the heavy, bulky, uncomfortable suit, except for the fact that it now takes him a good 14 minutes just to go pee.Another cook, Calypso Villacourt, said that she hates that it messes up her braids, and she now constantly feels like she’s some kind of weird space alien from the planet Sinsemilla.But hamburger patty-shaper, Antonio Sandwater, simply said that his girlfriend (Freckles) thinks that he is just the cutest thing since baby bunnies.Tony winked, and said that now Freckles actually gets extremely turned on when he gets home dressed in his Hazzy, as she calls it.[WRITER'S NOTE: Antonio blushed as he said that, at this rate, Freckles will most probably be getting pregnant in four or five days.];FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

84;Employees at home working hard at pretending to work;OTTAWA – Millions of Canadians working from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic have started their days off pretending to be hard at work.“I could read these documents that my manager sent to me,” pondered a corporate business analyst Jason Markle while playing World of Warcraft. “But I’m putting a lot of effort into level five, so I might have to work overtime.”Those who work in sectors deemed non-essential or have their workplaces closed entirely wouldn’t let the coronavirus get in the way of their lack of productivity.Home offices, which were set up as an elaborate facade for “work,” were immediately abandoned within minutes of the workday for pursuits such as cooking, reading, or masturbating.“Catching up on the Bachelor will be very important for the relationship with my co-workers and help prevent future conflicts over spoilers,” explained teacher Sandra Wong justifying how she spent the past three hours. “Jesus, I can’t believe Peter got dumped!”At press time, thousands of government employees added ‘Netflix’ to their performance agreements.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
85;Breaking: All the news happening all at once;EARTH – According to reports from every single human being’s television, social media and worried mothers, all the news is currently happening right now.“I took a 10 minute shower and when I got out, I had about 8000 breaking news alerts,” said Alberta resident Marilyn Dupont. “By the time I finished clearing those, the Prime Minister was in quarantine and every single event I was supposed to go to in the next 4 months had been cancelled.”Though there have been many busy news days before (9/11, Pearl Harbour, that time Rob Ford said “I’ve got more than enough to eat at home” in reference to cunnilingus) never before has there been a 24-hour period where everything that could happen did happen.“Breaking News: the NBA and NHL have suspended play! But first more breaking news Donald Trump suppressed coronavirus tests to help his re-election! And breaking news the Dow Jones is plummeting! But first Breaking: all schools are closed! And even more breaking than the last breaking news the President of Brazil has coronavirus! All that and more after the Breaking News that Parliament is suspended!!!” said CBC anchor Ian Hanomansing before collapsing in exhaustion.While researchers at Health Canada warn Canadians to take basic precautions against the covid-19 outbreak, they warn even more strongly about the human brain’s capacity to absorb breaking news at such an accelerated rate.“Our synapses can only take so much,” explained Dr. Melinda Kapoor, of Health Canada. “We’ve only evolved to parse out so much information at one time, like a natural disaster, or that time all the celebrities took a selfie together at the Oscars. But the information overload we’re seeing right now could very well lead to cases of rage paralysis, sphincter clenching, or SPB (Spontaneous Brain Melt).”Dr. Kapoor continued, “If Canadians experience any of these breaking news-related symptoms, please lie down on the couch and watch Netflix’s “Love Is Blind” until the feeling subsides.”In related news, during the time you were reading this article the United Kingdom had sunk into the sea, probably.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;Team Canada to be divided based on petty regional differences;OTTAWA – The Canadian Olympic Committee announced the 2020 Olympic team will be divided into several separate teams based on petty regional differences and long standing disputes between provinces.Team Laurentian Elites, Team Quebec, Team Western Alienation, and the Pacific Hippies as well other areas with narrow-minded grievances will all be participating on independent teams with their own flags and regional anthems.“We are encouraging our formerly unified Team Canada athletes to fight among each other on the basis of where they were born or reside,” said the former chef de mission for Team Canada Marnie McBean. “Creating divisions is the best way to inspire our athletes whether it be over the use of natural resources or having a funny accent.”Team Quebec has demanded that their anglophone wrestling opponents be one-third the size of Quebec athletes to protect their distinct culture. The region’s water polo roster was temporarily suspended after their helmets were mistaken for religious headgear.Team Central Canada requested Team Western Alienation reduce the number of basketball players on the court since they had a larger share of the population.“I am told we should be given two additional points since oil prices are low,” said Alberta-born soccer goalie Erin McLeod to her former Team Canada teammate and BC-native Christine Sinclair. “Also, I’m told that referees excessively regulate the matches with red tape and unfair rules, which prevent my region from winning.”Meanwhile the GTA’s Baseball squad was attempting to locate the rest of Canada on a map to play their Olympic qualifier with Team North.At press time, Team Maritimes was already forgotten about.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
87;Alberta Court of Appeal orders climate change to respect provincial boundaries;EDMONTON – Before striking down the federal carbon tax as unconstitutional, the Alberta Court of Appeal has ordered climate change to only occur within provincial borders according to how each province regulates it.“The actions of this potentially catastrophic atmospheric phenomenon intrudes on powers granted to provinces under Section 92 of the constitution,” ruled Chief Justice Catherine Fraser writing for the majority. “The provinces have jurisdiction over natural resources and therefore the ability to regulate their own climates like a car owner has the ability to adjust their vehicle’s climate control without federal interference.”The court requested that any flood, heat wave or other deadly consequence of climate change must be halted at provincial boundaries or will be declared unconstitutional.Devastating wildfires will need permission from a neighbouring jurisdiction to cross boundaries, which can be negotiated through an Internal Agreement on Fires where additional levies may be applied per flame.“If a province chooses to do nothing about climate change, the atmospheric results will remain contained within their 62 mile high climate containment fences,” said Justice Thomas Wakeling in a separate decision. “Provinces have the responsibility of closing the door behind them when any citizens want to travel beyond the borders so no climate change will escape to another jurisdiction.”;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;Shower wondering if it’s ever going to see you again;YOUR BATHROOM – In the midst of a nationwide quarantine prompting citizens all over Canada to self-isolate, your shower just wanted to let you know that it was curious if it was ever going to see you again.“Look, I don’t want to pry into your personal hygiene or make you uncomfortable,” the shower said, gazing down at the depressingly barren tub below. “But it’s now been over a week since we’ve spent any time together. I’m getting worried about you. And, if I’m being honest, I’m feeling a bit abandoned. We’ve always had such a good two-way relationship, and now I feel like you don’t care about me anymore.”The shower made a point of noting that it only knew you were alive in the first place because it heard the songs you are constantly singing to your cat in the living room. It also brought up the fact that you haven’t changed out of the same pair of sweatpants the entire time you’ve been quarantined.“I understand from overhearing your phone calls that you are choosing to sequester yourself at home for the good of the world, and I really applaud your efforts,” the shower continued, mournfully swinging a loofah hanging from its nozzle. “But seriously, have you no self-respect? Does this lifestyle not bother you? Can you not smell yourself?”Despite your newfound neglect, the shower just wanted to make it very clear that it is a safe space for you to return to.“You can come back to me whenever you’re ready. I miss our sexy times together. And the times when we would both cry, but you couldn’t tell because there was already water everywhere. God, I’m fogging up just thinking about it.”At press time, your shower was contemplating calling your therapist.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
89;Notorious hot air balloon thief’s getaway foiled by gentle breeze;LETHBRIDGE, AB – The infamous ‘Basket Bandit,’ scourge of the dirigible community, was finally caught today when his attempt to abscond with a large rainbow balloon was thwarted by a gentle breath of warm wind from the west.“I curse the Chinook!” the bandit, whose real name is James Turner, shouted as he was taken into custody by Detective Beatrix Lamar. “My plan was foolproof, it would’ve been the perfect crime! The perfect crime! If these things could, you know, go where you want them to.”Detective Lamar, the head of Lethbridge’s Hot Air Balloon and Blimp Crime Squad, has been chasing Turner since he first burst onto the balloon theft scene with the storied RE/MAX heist of 2005. That theft shook the ballooning world, inspiring numerous copycats and a noticeable uptick in attempted balloonjackings and sky piracy, the majority of which thankfully failed due to steering difficulties.“His capture was the result of teamwork, experience, and the fact that balloons pretty much just go wherever the air currents take them,” Lamar explained. “This current happened to take him right above our police station.”“This is a big win for justice, and for me personally,” said Lamar. “We’ve been playing a psychological game of cat-and-mouse for years. I can’t tell you how many ballooners I’ve brought in for questioning, how many I’ve put away on charges of basket or burner infractions in the hopes that one of them might be him. And still, every year, like clockwork, he’d taunt me on my birthday by sending me a bouquet of balloons.”“Now, thankfully, this era of slow, cloud hopping lawlessness is finally over.”At press time, Turner had somehow obtained a pair of roller skates and was slowly attempting to escape from police custody by skating up a steep hill.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;Two-year-old’s backup teddy bear on thin fucking ice;WINNIPEG —- Reports have confirmed that Mr. Broccoli, a teddy bear who has for most of the afternoon been subbing in for two-year-old Eleanor McWilson’s favourite teddy bear, Pinky, is going to be lucky if he lasts one more hour in this job.“We really thought he was up to the job,” Eleanor’s mother, Rose, nervously told reporters. “Pinky really needed to go through the laundry, and Mr. Broccoli looks so much like her except that his ears are a little pointier. On paper, he’s entirely qualified.”“But it turns out he just doesn’t have…it, you know?”The workday reportedly got off to a bad start when Eleanor asked Mr. Broccoli if he wanted some tea, but the new hire then inexplicably fell over onto the tea he had asked for.“It was as though he didn’t even like the tea. I mean, really?!” Eleanor’s father Matt said in an increasingly heated interview. “He gets one chance to make a good impression on the boss, and JUST as she’s about to serve him some cream from the Elsa jug, he just faceplants in the tea? Like, does he even understand what a big career opportunity imaginary tea is?”Although Mr. Broccoli has been Eleanor’s backup teddy bear for nearly six months (after being promoted when her former number two, Sleep Cow, fell into a fish tank), he has been afforded few opportunities to make an in-person impression on her. The most recent example of workplace face-time before this afternoon was the time head bear Pinky made Eleanor cry by being “a bear and not a baby shark”.However, Matt and Rose are still cautiously optimistic that Mr. Broccoli can pull this career move back on track.“If she asks him to climb up to the top of the couch, I know he can really shine.” Matt told reporters. “Mr Broccoli’s annual review showed his scampering skills to be—WAIT! ELEANOR! DON’T PUT HIM IN THE GREEN BIN—“At press time, Mr. Broccoli has been replaced as backup teddy bear by a really promising up-and-comer named “tupperware container missing a lid”.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
91;Man screaming on roller coaster just listening to Goosebumps on audiobook;ANAHEIM, CA – After strapping in to ride the Incredicoaster at Disneyland with a group of fellow theme park thrill seekers, Toronto native Charles Hernandez’s screams were revealed to be caused by listening to R.L Stein’s classic children’s series Goosebumps on audiobook.After the rise in the popularity of audiobooks in recent years, studies have shown that up to 40% of screams at any given moment in theme parks, grocery stores and museums have been attributed to the spooky narrative and bone-chilling dialogue of Stein’s famed series.“It’s just infuriating,” describes ride operator Edward Khan. “We walked by to secure the passenger and when we pushed down the safety guard he jumped so hard we had to re-do the whole procedure. When the ride finished? I had to rub his head and tell him that monsters weren’t real.”“And he was just drenched in sweat.”“Oh man that was a wild ride,” Hernandez remarked. “That creepy puppet story had so many crazy twists and turns. I can’t even think of the name Slappy without getting shivers! I gotta get some of those invisible headphones everyone else was wearing. Couldn’t even tell they were listening to the same story!”The trend also comes as more reports of zoo-patrons have been seen wearing headphones while marveling at the animals, assuming they were the main characters of the audio book Animorphs.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
92;TTC adequate for first time in 40 years;TORONTO – Bragging that it had been “two whole days” since they had to use shuttle buses, authorities report that for the first time since the late 20th century, Toronto’s mass transit system has the capacity to reliably handle the city’s transportation needs.“The TTC has been consulting with experts as this crisis develops,” said TTC spokesperson Stuart Green, “and we are proud to report that for the first time since 1981, the majority of riders were able to get on the Dufferin bus on their first try.”Further tests confirmed a lack of delays, and an increasing number of rides that commuters described as “okay” and “pleasant”.“Oh, I get it now,” said commuter Mary Silva, as her streetcar swiftly travelled down Queen Street, free of traffic and short turns. “This is how my parents must have felt when they took the streetcar.”The 31 year old, who isn’t wealthy enough to stop going to work and self-isolate, first noticed something was different when the Presto card reader was able to read her card and deduct her fare without having to wave it repeatedly in front of the reader or look to the driver to wave her in.“I thought, ‘okay, that’s weird,’” said Silva, describing her experience. “But when I was actually able to get a seat, that’s when I knew something was really up. Like, all right, what the hell is going on?”Commuters aren’t the only ones adapting to this blast from the past. TTC staff are also coping with occurrences not experienced in over a generation.“I’m not going to lie and say it’s easy,” says operator Dale Mulkin. “It’s hard enough getting used to the functioning signal system, but did you know that when I said something over the intercom yesterday everyone in that carriage was able to discern what I was saying? The elders spoke of a time when announcements could be understood, but we always thought it was mere legend, a fantasy borne of perms, leg warmers, and cocaine.”Municipal officials are taking the opportunity to learn as much as possible.“When 1 PM rolled around and I realized there had been no reports of delays, derailments, power outages, fires, or fatalities from the TTC, well, I had to go see it for myself,” said Mayor John Tory, glancing around the train in awe as he took in his first ever subway ride.“You know, this is actually really good,” he remarked, taking in the calm and speed of his journey.“Maybe I should have used all that Gardiner money for this instead,” he pondered aloud, before adding, “Nah.”;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
93;Eglinton LRT construction extended just long enough to be cancelled at last minute;TORONTO — With the recent announcement that the long-under-construction Eglinton LRT will be completed in 2022, the TTC has assured riders that this is only to ensure that the entire project can be scrapped as late as possible.“We understand that the Eglinton Crosstown construction has caused traffic delays for years now,” claimed TTC head of Central Planning, Geoff Mesters. “Now that the project is dangerously close to being completed, we want to assure riders that it will be wholly abandoned, in order to preserve current levels of service.”“As for the 10 years of construction it will require to fill in the hole, that’s just the icing on the cake,” added Mesters.The decision to delay the cancellation of the Eglinton Crosstown is reportedly a joint initiative between several layers of government. Toronto City Council recently voted overwhelmingly to halt the LRT project after recently-disgraced Councillor Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough—Agincourt) argued, “I for one am sick and tired of Wards that aren’t my Ward getting things and stuff!”Similarly, Premier Doug Ford agreed that the LRT should be scrapped as far into 2022 as possible, for maximum cost to Ontarians. “If we can lose money selling marijuana and somehow botch license plates, we can absolutely fuck up a project that is 90% complete” commented Ford.“Also, go to hell Toronto,” added Toronto resident Doug Ford.Representatives for Metrolinx assured Torontonians that the project cancellation would be timed for maximum heartbreak. “We plan to wait until the last possible second,” said one Metrolinx spokesperson. “Ideally there will have already been a ribbon-cutting ceremony, and commuters will be taking their first steps onto the LRT. That’s the exact moment when we will announce a ‘service delay’, which will of course be permanent.”Metrolinx has also assured Ontarians that by the time of cancellation Bombardier will have been overpaid by millions, and have already raised PRESTO fares accordingly. They then forecast that the soon-to-be-abandoned tunnels will be “a wonderful place for local teens to smoke pot and have terrible sex.”Meanwhile, several local residents remain unimpressed at the wait. “Nowadays it takes forever for the TTC to cancel projects,” explained longtime Eglinton West resident Lester Reynolds. “You got that Scarborough subway that’s been limping along for nearly a decade now. Back in my day, Mike Harris would cancel half-built transit projects in half the time!”Looking forward, transit experts are exploring options to turn the abandoned Eglinton Crosstown tunnel into a series of Starbuckses, an extra already-congested highway, or one 12-kilometer long underground condo.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;Commuters warned not to retrieve items dropped on subway tracks unless it’s your phone in which case fair enough;TORONTO — Subway passengers are being warned never to attempt to reach for personal articles that have fallen onto the subway tracks, unless it’s their cell phone because how are you just going to leave that there?Speaking out on the matter is Mark Gormman, head of track safety at Toronto’s independent Transit Safety Council. “Rider safety is our number one concern, and nobody wants anyone to get hurt on the subway tracks,” insisted Gormman. “We understand the temptation to try and brave the tracks to get back a lost wallet or set of house keys, but it’s just not worth the risk – unlike for say a new iPhone 11, which costs at least $900. What are you going to do, leave it there to possibly get run over?”“You can probably make it in time,” added Gormman.The Toronto Transit Commission has consistently warned riders of track level dangers, including oncoming trains, filthy uneven tracks, and of course the electrified third rail. “All dangers that completely pale next to losing your phone filled with all your apps, passwords, and personal photos,” explained the Transit Safety Council’s Gormman. “And if you have nudes on there, why are we even having this discussion? Go! Go! Go!”Gormman also reminded phone-retrieving riders that there is only a one in three chance of touching the electrified rail, and that they can also probably avoid an oncoming train by jumping to the other tracks.Local subway passenger Jeff Arnbold recounted one such experience. “I saw some guy jump down onto the tracks and I was so angry, until I realized he was going after that new facial recognition iPhone, and that’s so sick.”“Plus,” the guard added, “the fine he paid was way less than say evading a TTC fare.”Despite numerous posted signs advising customers to call security to retrieve any items that have fallen to track level, the Transit Safety Council has proposed carving out a clause for any smartphone, Apple Watch, or in some extreme cases, “like a Nintendo Switch, or something”. Reached for comment, a TTC spokesperson responded, “What the hell are you talking about? Stay off the damn tracks!”While the Gormman and the Transit Safety Council also urge riders to stay off the tracks, not just for their personal safety but for the risk of causing significant travel delays for the entire subway line, they warn even more strongly about the delays you will experience from a lost phone.“How the hell would you even function in the year 2020 without your phone,” asked an exasperated Gormman. “I can’t even make it from Pape Station down to the Ex without using Google Maps. Without your phone your entire day would be absolutely fucked.”At press time the TTC was experiencing major service disruptions, leaving you with even more time to get down there and get your phone quick!

98;New law requires Quebec to show its racism visibly;QUEBEC CITY – Quebec Premier François Legault has announced that his government has passed legislation requiring all citizens of Quebec to visibly show their contempt for religious and racial minorities.“No Quebecer will be allowed to hide behind the veil of secularism or some kind of other excuse that we use to justify our hate,” said Legault whose CAQ government recently passed Bill 21 and Bill 9. “If you’re a true resident of this province, you’ll prove it by not beating around the bush about how you really feel about Muslims, Jews, or Sikhs.”The legislation requires anyone in a position of authority to demonstrate an open fear of a white genocide, actively deny provincial services for wearing religious headgear, and substitute actual diversity for blackface.“We’ve done our part by institutionalizing fear and division between Quebecers, but what have you done for Quebec?” rhetorically asked the province’s Minister of Emmigration and Exclusion Simon Jolin-Barrette to the media. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to shred 18,000 immigration application files for purely xenophobic reasons.”Also contained in the new law is a requirement for every resident of Quebec to complete a mandatory Quebec values test to determine if citizens are bigoted enough to stay.The rest of Canada was shocked that a province with the lowest high school graduation rate would pass such an outwardly discriminatory law instead of being a little more subtle.At press time, Quebec’s new secularism police arrested a motorist for praying to a deity in hopes that the bridge he was driving on would not collapse.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Bring Michael home!” shouted the demonstrators while taking pictures using their new HUAWEI P30 PRO smartphone including the 6.47 inch OLED Dewdrop display which captured images of the show of solidarity with stunning clarity. “She has committed no crime.”Other protesters held signs claiming that Huawei should be allowed to construct all of Canada’s 5G network.“Canada trusts a reliable and efficient company, like the maker of the HUAWEI MediaPad M5 lite, featuring a brilliant 10.1-inch 1080p display so you will not miss a thing while watching your favourite movies or playing games,” said a bright-eyed youngster so full of hope that Canada will let Meng free.“We have no case and are wasting taxpayers dollars,” said the Crown prosecutor who was trying to extradite the former CFO of Huawei to the US to face fraud charges. “I made all my notes for this case using my HUAWEI MateBook X Pro.”An Angus-Reid poll indicated that 85% of Canadians want Meng to be immediately acquitted and released, but had we been paid $200, it would be 100%.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Jim Jordan. “Plus, inane Republican props are so much cheaper to be made here.”There’s no shortage of extras and small roles to be filled from photographer #3 to concerned witness lawyer with serious-looking briefcase.“We were worried that the writing the Rep Devin Nunes character would come across as too evil and bumbling, but viewers absolutely love his comedic portrayal of a Congressman,” said Swain.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
103;Oh great, the Gastown Steam Clock is vaping now;UGH. Just when you wanted some relief from that tacky tourist clock Vancouverites love to hate, the timepiece has taken up vaping so it can be even more unbearable.It seems like this young, impressionable ticker picked up the habit from some other steam clocks, and can’t stop puffing its Juul every 15 minutes trying to look like it’s some time piece from the not-too-distant future.Wow, you’re so cool now, Victorian clock that was actually built in 1977.Now, this Big Ben-wannabe is pouring out a sickly-sweet tropical smell of a strawberry and pineapple blend along with plenty of nicotine, and no one asked for it.Go chime somewhere else, you douchey time keeper.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;Rest of Canada happy to exchange NWT election results for federal one;YELLOWKNIFE – Polls indicate that a majority of Canadians would accept the results of today’s legislative election in NWT if it replaced the federal vote later this month.87% of exhausted Canadians appeared to be all but happy with allowing Northerners they’ve never heard of take the reins of power in Ottawa if it would stop a nauseating federal election campaign.“[NWT] Legislature Candidates appear to be more qualified than a guy who lies about being an insurance broker,” said Fiona Crisp of Toronto. “And none of them have been seen in blackface or brownface, so that’s a bonus.”Canadians agreed that candidates like the ones in the Range Lake constituency such as Caroline Cochrane or Hughie Graham will not be disappointing like Elizabeth May or Jagmeet Singh.89% of Canadians say reducing the number of representatives from 338 to 16 would be “efficient” or “very efficient” if it meant an end to those damned commercials or obnoxious text messages from “Sarah” about the carbon tax.“No political parties? Consensus government? Am I hearing this right?” asked Mohammed Bukhari of Calgary in amazement of how elected members work together in Canada’s most populous territory. “I will happily accept their leader whoever that is when the Legislature in Whitehorse determines it.

105;Conservation officers safely tranquilize municipal elections candidate wandering through neighbourhood;WHITEHORSE – A vote hungry municipal candidate roaming through the Whitehorse neighbourhood of Riverdale was safely removed by conservation officers yesterday.The 185 lbs pamphlet-wielding beast was tranquilized after getting too close to properties and frightening locals by inviting them to talk about politics.“I just saw him right at my front porch and he was knocking at my door,” said Arlene Chavers who had a close encounter with the candidate, but avoided any interaction by pretending to be not at home. “They are majestic contenders, but I’d rather avoid them entirely. They could have dangerous opinions that I disagree with.”Conservation officers from Environment Yukon reminded the public that candidates are awake after a three year hibernation and sightings will be common.“Please remove your garbage as that will only antagonize the creature to talk about waste pick-up,” advised a conservation officer. “Keep in mind the different species of candidate: If you’re approached by a mayoral candidate, play dead. Council candidates, by contrast, are easily spooked by shouting ‘I already voted!’”If you are ever directly approached, nod your head in agreement about property taxes or land-use development while backing away slowly and closing the door.“And while there isn’t an election going on for a school board,” added the conservation officer, “never be in the proximity of a school board trustee candidate and her cubs.”;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Barry McLean. “It’s unfortunate that we can no longer be the official sponsor of this critical connection.”The territorial governments are looking for a more inspiring sponsor other than a bread company, such as toothpaste, yogurt, or any other grocery item.The highway will remain open for residents, tourists, and anyone who wants chip in their windshield.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

108;Gaming the system: Recent 92-year-old university grad gets to die before she pays off her debt;VANCOUVER – A clever UBC grad has found an ingenious way to avoid paying her costly student debts by dying soon after graduation.“With age comes wisdom,” said 92-year-old Barbara Harrison who studied science for the past four years. “These younger folks think that living with a lifetime burden of paying it off is worth it. I was on my third hip when I decided to go back to school.”The nonagenarian has overcome many challenges in her life from raising four children to the loss of her husband in 1997, but paying back a $42,000 fee for her education won’t be one of them.“I’ve lived through World War II, the moon landing, and the exponential rise in school fees,” said the widower who suffers from osteoporosis and parkinsons. “The dumb bastards at the student aid office think I can live until I’m 124.”Fellow graduates fondly reflected on Harrison’s ability to never let age or mortality get in the way of their friendship.“She would just take back her heart medication with a shot of tequila,” said housemate Trisha Lui about her friend affectionately known as Babbling Babbs.Doctors don’t expect her to make it before her Fall convocation.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

110;Low-income student receiving free tuition to be given Ontario’s $348 billion debt next year;TORONTO – The Ontario government has announced that it will balance the budget by 2020 as it will be transferring its entire debt of the province on second year sociology student and free tuition recipient Andy Bordell.The 19-year-old studying at Ryerson will be required to pay roughly $6,500 in tuition fees plus hundreds of billions in arrears for the hospitals, schools, police stations, and other goods and services provided by his province.“We’re offering Andy a great 10% discount on tuition fees, which will save him $650 per year,” said Training, Colleges and Universities Minister Merrliee Fullerton. “With an added savings of 0.00000000018% to his total debt once he graduates, we’ve given him a head start.”The provincial government believes that Bordell can pay off a small portion of his student/sovereign debt by the time he’s 800, which is also the approximate time he should be able to find a stable job that pays more than minimum wage.“Going to school for free for a year was a real privilege for these youngsters,” said Fullerton. “And by free, we mean only tuition since things like food and housing is not covered.

112;Acadia University: The Beaverton University Reviews;Name: Acadia UniversityNickname: Itsy-Bitsy Teeny-Weeny Yellow Polka-Dot UniversityMotto: “Please do not force us leave our homes” (In use since the 1700s)History:Acadia University was founded in 1838, when the town of Wolfville became so boring that a seminary spontaneously appeared. Initially, there were 21 students at the University, the entire population of people in Nova Scotia at the time. Since then, enrollment has decreased by some 40%. I cannot stress enough to you how small this university is. It is like a little tiny bird of a university that sits in the palm of your hand and chirps naively and you could crush it any time that you chose to crush it, but you choose not to because it is so, so sweet. It is a sweet little university and we love it very much.Thanks to misleading advertisements, new students arrive show up expecting four years of perfect blue skies, peaceful cohabitation, and amazing oral sex when really they’ll only be getting overcast weather, roommates who don’t clean, and average-to-pretty-good oral sex (unless you’re a straight woman, in which case, give these 19-year old boys a break).According to both Wikipedia and the university’s website, Acadia cannot account for its whereabouts or activities between the years of 1893 and 1996, a span of time in which over 4000 unsolved murders were committed. Of course, we don’t think that Acadia was responsible for any of those. After all, such a sweet, cute little university couldn’t possibly have committed such horrible acts, could it?Could it?Anyway, Acadia currently offers mandatory undergraduate classes in “Advanced Shallow Graves”, “Introductory Alibi Construction”, and “How Long It Will Take The Insects To Eat The Corpse of My Victim? 101”Acadia was shut down by teacher’s strikes in the years of 2004 and 2007, but both strikes were resolved when the teacher returned from getting coffee.Pros:– Close-knit student community means everyone will know, and have an opinion on, all the stupid things you do during your undergrad.– President Ray Ivany has a motorbike, leather jacket and is super lame… If you think that making a jukebox work just by smacking it is lame, you blind fool.– “Slutten Cutten” is an annual sex-positive party at Cutten residence, and is also the name of a Brock Stapleton slasher flick from the 1970s about an annual sex-positive party at a university residence that is interrupted by a scythe-wielding maniac. But don’t worry, Cutface isn’t a real person, right?Cons:– 1/5th the size of Dalhousie, Acadia also only has 1/5th of a Registrar. Good luck changing your program, because Registrar Mound of Offal is busy in near-constant meetings with a bunch of crows and vultures.– Wolfville is home to Little Wolfville, the largest Lupine settlement outside of Wolfmerica. Unfortunately, the area is being rapidly gentrified. Visit Savelilwolfville.com to learn more.– As many as one third of you will perish at sea. (Grand Derangement joke, swish)– The black mold that shut down Cutten House for five years is back, and is very sexually transmitted this time.Did you know?…That Soldiers from Boston have been sailing over and collecting scalps from Acadia students since the early 1700s?…That the 2012 Cheaton Cup hockey/drinking fundraiser raised $2500 for cystic fibrosis through donations and $35,000 for the township of Wolfville through liquor-related fines?…Acadia has only one doctoral program because it managed to cut off the heads of all the other Acadia doctoral programs?…That optimists and pessimists have differing views on the half-completed Crowell Tower?…That in the late ‘90s, the Acadia Advantage program issued all students notebook computers?

Founded in 1818. First class, not until 1838. George Ramsay, 9th Earl of Dalhousie, was a freemason, who “died” in 1838. Not just any freemason either: between 1767 and 1769 he was the Grandmaster of Scotland.Now listen. Listen to me. Are you listening to me right now? Look behind me.

And is it a coincidence that ‘brewery’ is a word with nine letters, if you add the letters “P” and “S”, which stand for PHILOSOPHER’S STONE? That’s right, the ‘mythological’ stone that can make any man, or should I say freemason, immortal?Yeah. How about that. Starting to piece things together in that tiny mind of yours yet, you monkey-brain?And why, if I’m so crazy, was that first course at Dalhousie taught by a certain Professor H.

114;OCAD University: University Reviews 2014;Name: OCAD UniversityNickname: The Jenga of UniversitiesMotto: “You can’t put a price on art. Wait, yes you can, it’s $6,000 a semester”History:OCAD University was originally founded as the Ontario School of Art in 1876: a place where prim little dandies and elegant fops could escape the beastly, just beastly, treatment of their fathers, whose rough, leathery brains would never truly appreciate the struggles of young alcoholics with access to paint.The school instituted Victorian life-drawing courses in 1894, which consisted of various women showing one, or, in the upper year class, both ankles for students to draw. The ankles were of course kept behind a screen to prevent an outbreak of Ankle Madness among the male students.OCAD’s most recognizable building, the Sharp Centre for Design (pictured above), was added in 2004. The expansion has received multiple prestigious architectural awards, including the “Least Accessible for People With Vertigo” Award, the “How The Fuck Does It Stay Up?” Award, and the “Seriously, Is It Like… Magnets?” Award.OCAD’s least recognizable building, the Blunt Centre for Getting High (not pictured above) is located in Dan’s mom’s basement.In 2008, president Sara Diamond changed the pedagogy to reflect an increased emphasis on sleeve tattoos, pink dreadlocks and fancy little moustaches for fancy little fellows.As of 2010 the acronym “OCAD” no longer stands for “Ontario College of Art and Design”. Does this confirm rumours that the institution was really founded as a temple for the ancient Sumerian Demon Prince, OC’AD, He Who Is The Great Defiler of All Art?Historians say, no.But we aren’t fucking historians.We are artists, and we demand that you listen to our crazy ideas.Pros:– Last year’s pictureless but full-price art history textbooks taught students a valuable lesson in how to go fuck themselves.– Admission requirements include getting an unusual body piercing.– Good visual art will be put on the college’s giant refrigerator door.– Design students will learn the many ways of making undesirable products desirable. For example, is it unsmooth? Make it smooth. Also: People like touch screens.– Each graduating class gets to keep one of the giant struts holding up the Sharp Centre.Cons:– Due to the above tradition, OCAD will be forced to close in 2019.– Your oil painting that represents the inherent injustice of capitalist systems you spent 8 months working on will be sold to a corporate lawyer who needs something to match his sofa.-You don’t know anything about science or history, but check out this rocking chair you made out of clocks. It’s a metaphor.– Dad won’t actually appreciate it when you nail together all his two-by-fours for your “deconstruction of wood” art project.Did you know?…Classrooms are set up so that an equal number of students are seated in each corner of the building so that it doesn’t tip over to one side?…That if you take life drawing they’ll just, like, let you look at naked people for 3 hours a week?…That the staff at the Village Idiot are usually okay with it if you vomit in a pint glass at your table? At least that is true in the experience of this one humble writer.…That most of the above stuff isn’t true, but, like, isn’t art just supposed to question the central pillars of human existence and isn’t truth, like, the most central pillar?Famous Alumni:That one guy who hangs out outside the pizzeria and stacks things that aren’t usually stackedBanksy – Well, not really.

115;Ryerson University: The Beaverton University Reviews;Name: Ryerson UniversityNickname: DaveMotto: “The best education you can get in a mall”History:In 1852 at the core of the present main campus, the historic St. James Square, Egerton Ryerson founded Ontario’s first teacher training facility, the Toronto Normal School. This came several years after the failure of Ryerson’s first project, the Toronto Weird school. Among the courses of study that failed to draw students to the Weird School were a master’s in Christmas Disco, a philosophical doctorate in *high pitched squealing noise, of the type you would expect a small animal to make if you began to crush it in a wine press* and a magical bachelor’s in Blah-blah-blooby-blah-humble-bumble-Flooby-Doo.Although the Weird School was an unmitigated disaster, many of the wacky theories and double-wacky values behind it are still at work at Ryerson University. For example, Ryerson claims to be a leader in applied, career-centric education as if “careers” are a thing that didn’t disappear when the recession hit in 2008.The Ryerson Institute of Technology was founded in 1948, although what kind of technology did they even have in 1948? Rocks? Things that you bashed with rocks? Sounds dumb to us. Suck on it, 1948! 21st century for life! [flips both middle fingers at the 20th century]Since then, Ryerson University has just been a place where bros and bristers can hang out, chill out, relax, and just fucking hang the fuck out!Some people wonder if there’s a funny story about how Ryerson University got the nickname ‘Dave’. The answer is, yes, and the funny story is that it is quicker to say ‘Dave’ than ‘Ryerson University’.Pros:– Nationally renowned film program gives the tools you’ll need to become the seminal director of your generation, just like the other 290 students in your class.– The Ryerson Endowment Fund invests in only the most globally-conscious, sustainable and community-minded companies, like Nike, Enbridge and Bloodpoison Ltd.– The Eaton Centre is next door if you want to buy some overpriced, low quality clothing, be surrounded by thousands of perpetually annoyed shoppers or if you just want to kick back and relax with some overpriced, low quality food while surrounded by thousands of perpetually annoyed shoppers.– Will probably be roommates with some dudes who nickname themselves “The Bong Squad”Cons:– For a school with such excellent Media programs, the Eyeopener and Ryersonian are two of the most poorly named student newspapers in the country (although, who are we to talk).– As most of Ryerson’s residences are apartment buildings, there are no RAs or Dons, only squat, greasy landlords who like to tell you how pretty you look and have screaming fights with their wives at, like, two in the goddamn morning.– The “Chang” in “Chang School of Continuing Education” is actually an acronym for “Cougars Hunting Adolescent, Nubile Gentlemen”. Hmm. This might not actually belong in the ‘cons’ section. I guess it depends on your opinion on cougars. Rawr!

116;NDP claim Liberals stole their idea to form majority government;OTTAWA — NDP leader Thomas Mulcair has blasted the incoming Liberal government for stealing his party’s idea to form a strong majority government.“The Liberals have always had a history of taking our ideas and claiming them as their own,” said Mulcair with an indirect hostility towards the election results. “Whether it be universal healthcare, pensions or winning a majority of seats in the House of Commons to take control of the legislative and executive branches of the federal government, Liberals can never come up with any original policy ideas.”Mulcair claimed that persuading 38% or more of the electorate to vote for his MPs has been patently an NDP idea from the very start.“The moment the writ dropped, I have always said I wanted to defeat Stephen Harper and form government. Trudeau just started saying that immediately after it became popular to say we need a new government.”At press time, dozens of NDP supporters were delivering inspiring, passive aggressive election posts reminding cynics that there’s still something to be outraged about.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;Sun newspapers still reporting Harper majority;Despite the results being posted two days ago, Sun newspaper outlets have steadfastly denied the existence of a Liberal majority government and have continued to assume Conservative leader Stephen Harper will carry on his mandate as Prime Minister.“We’re happy to report the Conservatives have won every seat in Parliament,” said a hysterical Toronto Sun editor-in-chief Adrienne Batra. “He will be our Prime Minister for the next 100 years. Harper is Lord! Harper is Lord!”The newspaper, known for reporting its alternative version of events, said that Harper swept all opposition parties in every riding after the Conservatives ran a campaign of truth, transparency, and patriotism.Psychologists explain this phenomena as the two stages of grief newspapers experience when their preferred candidate or political party loses an election.“The first stage is denial of the events that occurred,” explained Dr. Ravi Chodri, head of the University of Toronto’s psychology department. “Followed by anger, anger and more anger. And that’s it.”According to sources, the Globe and Mail has made progress in accepting the Trudeau Liberals victory, but has not accepted it as the next government.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
118;90-year-old who has never voted proudly casts first ballot for Social Credit party;WINNIPEG – For the first time in his long life, habitual abstainer Jack Pilman will cast a ballot in a Canadian election, throwing his support behind the Social Credit party.“Normally I just let the elections go on by, but this time it’s different. There’s an electricity in the air,” said Pilman. “We gotta get rid of that Harper skunk and it’s only [Social Credit party leader] John Horne Blackmore who’s got the stones to do it. And don’t nobody give him guff about being a Mormon! He’ll be judged for that in due time.”The Social Credit party was founded in 1935 in response to dissatisfaction with the handling of the Great Depression. The party enjoyed some success in the 40s but has had disastrous showings in each of the last few federal elections. Many experts believe this is due to the party dissolving in 1993.Pilman says that he’s had enough of the Conservatives pandering to the left.“Have you heard about this Tommy Douglas ponce? Running around, spouting off about socialized healthcare as if we aren’t five minutes away from being invaded by Krauts,” said Pilman. “Harper hasn’t said a dadgum thing about that troublemaker. If this nation doesn’t adopt the right-minded policies of Social Credit then soon we’ll all be hoeing fields under the yoke of layabouts and sluggards.”At press time, Pilman was considering strategically voting for the Unionists.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;Conservatives unveil last minute attack ad accusing Justin of supporting Kansas City;TORONTO – In a last minute gamble for GTA seats, the Conservative Party unveiled a new attack ad over the weekend suggesting Liberal leader Justin Trudeau wanted the Kansas City Royals to defeat the Toronto Blue Jays in the ALCS.“Justin Trudeau is a well known arsonist who liked the Harry Potter movies more than the books. But now he has gone too far,” the ad begins. “Just like his father Justin is a lifelong Kansas City Royals fan, and if he is elected he will do everything to make sure the Royals win the Pennant.”The ad goes on to claim that Justin wanted to propose a law to stop Jose Bautista from doing bat flips, and that he personally preferred it when the SkyDome’s roof was closed. The ad does not give much evidence for its claims, aside from the following passage.“Look at Justin in this baseball hat. From the back you can’t see what team he is supporting, but you can clearly make out the colour: Blue. The exact same colour as that of the Blue Jays opponent: the Kansas City Royals.”The ad concludes with the following passage,“On October 19, remember that a vote for Justin is a vote for that annoying Fox Sports commentator who said Canadians can’t catch.”;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
120;Japan, IOC postpone all 2020 Olympic events except fencing;TOKYO – Amid the rising COVID-19 pandemic, the International Olympic Committee along with the Japanese government has released a statement confirming that while the majority of the summer games will be postponed to 2021, the only sport allowed to compete this year will be fencing.A spokesperson from Tokyo’s organizing committee addressed reporters remotely via video call, saying, “In 1940, Japan had won the bid to host the summer and winter games, however both events were cancelled due to WWII. We will not surrender such a lucrative opportunity this time around, even if that means we can only offer thrusting and jabbing from a medically responsible distance.”Furthermore, beyond the standard white jacket, face mask, and gloves, fencers now are expected to don a full body hazmat suit, and alter their swords to be at least six feet long in order to avoid becoming too close to their opponents.Alberto Bianchi, head coach of the Italian fencing team is said to be conflicted about Japan’s decision to focus solely on the intricate combat sport.“Historically, Italy has brought home the most medals in fencing, so on the one hand that bodes well for our chances of sweeping the 2020 games,” said Bianchi from a quarantined gym in Rome. “However, you know with the whole lockdown stuff, right now is not the very best timing for us.”Many other athletes have attempted to plead their case to the IOC as to the safety of their respective sports. Dozens of Olympic volleyball and basketball players of different countries have signed an online petition promising to sanitize the ball between each volley, pass, and shot if allowed to compete.Tokyo 2020 has officially changed their motto from “Hope Lights Our Way” to “Beggars Can’t Be Choosers.”;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;China concerned Western authoritarian government will cover up coronavirus outbreaks;BEIJING – The Chinese government has expressed concerns that a North American government which lacks transparency and checks on its executive power will cover up the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak.“We don’t have confidence in the information coming out of the United States” said China’s President Xi Jinping to members of the international press. “The American Administration has been reluctant to accept that there are cases of coronavirus in the country. Only a few days ago, Mr. Trump said that the disease is not a problem and it would go away by April.”Chairman Donald Trump ascended to power in 2017 and seized control of the People’s Republican Party, and has since attempted to cover-up the suppression of his political opponents while releasing convicted supporters from jail.Vice Chairman Mike Pence, who will be responsible for dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak, has been accused of suppressing free speech after announcing all doctors and scientists are banned from speaking about the virus without Pence’s approval.Trump’s obsession with economic indicators rather than major health care reforms has countries like China worrying about the US causing a global pandemic.“America has repeatedly undermined the health care system of its citizens by denying many of them access to care,” said Xi. “For countries with Third World health care systems like the US, there may be no stopping this virus.”At press time, Pence announced US evangelical scientists have developed a prayer-based COVID-19 vaccine.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Sure it’s taking longer than I thought to control all telecommunications, but the silver lining is that we’re not being held accountable for the ongoing human rights abuses of the Uyghur ethnic minority.Huawei’s possible misuse of users’ data is the latest in a long series of things that the western press would rather report on than atrocities against the Uyghurs. Previous topics include: internet censorship; a trade war; the entirety of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games; the recent Coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan; and the fact that President Xi looks like Winnie the Pooh.China has also reportedly planned several new distracting stories in the coming months, including claiming sovereignty over Newfoundland, building a second great wall, and having President Xi finally dress like Winnie the Pooh.“Yes I live in constant fear and terror,” said Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region resident Turghun Balasaghuni. “But I get it, we’ve already been reported on so it’s boring now and CNN needs to keep their viewership up.”In a related story, Prime Minister Trudeau is grateful that Peter MacKay tweeting about his yoga is distracting from a lack of clean drinking water on reserves.";FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

124;Biden announces he’ll make more public appearances when Animal Crossing: New Horizons stops being so sick;WILMINGTON, DE- Following mounting public concern regarding Democratic candidate Joe Biden’s limited presence in the public eye, a his campaign announced Biden will begin addressing his constituents more frequently just as soon as Animal Crossing: New Horizons stops ruling so hard.“I understand it’s frustrating to have a presidential candidate go completely AWOL during such an unprecedented pandemic, but it’s also important voters know the facts,” said spokesperson Kelly MacPherson. “And the fact is, this game is just way too fucking sick.”According to inside sources, Biden has been unable to pry himself away from the idyllic simulation game since its release earlier this week. Experts cite the game’s introduction of crafting and terraforming as a key addictive feature, as it allows Biden to “grind all night long”, even when the shops close in the real-time game.“2012’s Animal Crossing: New Leaf was an OK game and caused minor problems during the final Obama term, but what we’re faced with now is unprecedented. New Horizons is just way too dope” said visibly exhausted speech writer Jon Simon, “He can’t stop building birdbaths and catching trout. The only way we can get him to do a televised address is when his avatar is sleeping. I was up until 6am last night. I miss my family.”Insiders point to one of Biden’s few recent appearances, an awkward remote interview with MSNBC’s Nicole Wallace, as another victim of his “falling hard down a Crossing hole”. Said one staffer, “People kept assuming Biden was fumbling his words because of his advanced age, but it’s because he kept trying to remember how many bells he owes Tom Nook for his farm expansion.”“Why can’t he be this kind of memory for real, non-cartoon video game policy,” added the frustrated staffer.While voters across the country have voiced anger at the presumptive Democratic contender for largely stepping out of the public eye during the mounting COVIS-19 crisis and looming economic collapse while other public officials, like opponent Bernie Sanders, have been making frequent virtual fireside chats, staffers were quick to defend their boss’ absence, saying that while he may not be addressing the public as frequently as others, he is still accessible.“Look if you’re so keen on talking to the guy, why don’t you just join his Switch friends list and visit his island?” questioned campaign staffer Bryce McQuinty. “Open up the chat keyboard and go catch butterflies together or something. Oh, and please for the love of God, if somebody out there has pears as their native fruit could you please invite Joe over to take one so he can plant it on his island? All day he just mumbles about the goddamn pears.”At press time, Biden staffers voiced concern over his new interest in more violent games, fearing that the former senator’s vote for the Iraq war would escalate to puppeteering excessive militarism from the safety of his own home, thusly causing him to lose interest in campaigning all together.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
125;Kremlin still can’t remember trigger word to activate Bernie Sanders;MOSCOW – A source inside the Kremlin has confirmed that the handlers of deep cover operative Bernie Sanders have lost the password needed to activate the commands placed in his subconscious.“Because the asset was embedded so long ago, a lot of overseers have come and gone,” said KGB operative Nicolai Lobanov, surrounded by boxes from the KGB’s record rooms. “I just pray to god we made it a Russian word so that no one will activate him by accident. If Sanders is still half as deadly as he was in Afghanistan, the carnage would be unimaginable. ”After months of Spetsnaz-level training and mental conditioning, Sanders was given the most American, anglo-saxon-sounding name possible and sent to the U.S. as a sleeper agent to infiltrate the American Senate as part of a campaign to destabilize the states. However, once hacking the election and spreading fake news proved the more effective means of protecting Russian interests, Sanders was left dormant, and began operating under his original orders of spreading communism by giving healthcare to everyone.Sanders was selected because, as a white straight male he is highly likely to become President. However there have been some doubts regarding Sanders’ chances of victory. This is most likely why the Kremlin is seeking to activate his hypnotic instructions to use his years of experience in the field to terminate any threats to the Trump administration, possibly including fellow Democrat Joe Biden.This lapse in information recording is proving to be a major source of stress for Lubanov, who is in danger of missing the peak time to activate Sanders. “Was it Vermont? No that’s too obvious.” Lubinov said, rubbing his temples. “1%of the 1%? No. Huge, but pronounced Yuge?. Damn it, I was sure we had it on a post-it note somewhere.”In related news, the majority of Kremlin officials strongly oppose making us of Canadian sleeper agent Andrew Scheer.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
126;Biden within hair-sniffing distance of Democratic nomination;WASHINGTON – After being declared the winner of the final Democratic debate by several publications and continuing to lead in the primary delegate count, Joe Biden is now within hair-sniffing distance of being the Democratic candidate for the presidency of the United States.Commentators point to Biden’s clear messaging about being a calming voice (directly into your ear, from far too close) in a troubled time, and his distinction from Sanders who “just lobs bombs from the sidelines” while Biden “gets things done” (like slowly massaging your shoulders without your consent).Biden also made headlines by announcing during the debate that he would name a woman to be his running mate. While it is presumed that the woman will be one of his earlier challengers in the primary, it has not been ruled out that it might also be a random woman whose arm Biden grabs suddenly at a rally, or whose shoulder he squeezes unexpectedly during a donor lunch.It is unclear whether the COVID-19 epidemic will impact Biden’s chances, as new social distancing norms make it difficult for him to practice his signature brand of hands-on politics. Still, he continues to please pundits with his steadfast leadership, bravery, and naked disdain for personal space, as he encourages voters to pack tightly into polling stations despite the virulent outbreak.Bernie Sanders, by contrast, does appear to be farther and farther from clinching the nomination, which he is compensating for by getting louder and louder.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

128;Village virgin sick of donating blood to every ritual sacrifice;CHESHIRE, UK – After years of being the lone contributor to her village’s sacrificial blood rituals due only to the fact that she is a virgin, 18-year-old Josephine Paine finally spoke out in an effort to draw attention to the unfairness of her plight.“I just want to know why my blood is so much more special than anyone else’s!” she huffed, wrapping a bandage around a puncture wound on her arm after a bloodletting that very morning. “Because every time we all gather to place a curse on the town next door, it’s all ‘Bring forth the virgin,’ this, and ‘Josephine, only thy blood can summon the locusts’ that, but no one ever gives me a reason for it.”Jonas Fletcher, village blacksmith and head of the local cult, was hesitant to talk about the inner workings of his followers’ rituals, but maintained that he was just following orders from above.“It’s the way it has always been,” he explained, taking a break from carving Satan’s horns into the underside of his bed frame. “You can’t argue with tradition. Lucifer demands only the purest blood. I’d do it myself, but hey, I get too much smock, if you know what I mean.”Despite threats of being branded as a witch by the village mayor, Josephine is refusing to back down in her quest for equality.“I know for a fact that Thomas Brooker down the street is a virgin too, and no one goes running to him when it hasn’t rained in a month,” she fumed, after recovering from a short anemia-driven fainting spell. “I’m just saying, I feel like I’m being punished for not being married five years after most of my girlfriends have had their third child.”At press time, the village elders were unsuccessfully attempting to explain why layfolk could give blood to the yearly harvest ritual if they really wanted to, but men who had recently lain with other men could not.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

132;NCAA searching for new ways to exploit student athletes after cancellation of March Madness;INDIANAPOLIS, IN – The cancellation of college basketball’s March Madness tournament due to the COVID-19 crisis has left the NCAA scrambling to find new ways to exploit their 500,000 student athletes.The tournament brings in almost a billion dollars to the NCAA through TV deals and ticket sales of which exactly zero dollars goes to the student athletes playing the games. This represents some 80% of the NCAA’s annual income. While insurance will cover some of the lost revenue, this still leaves a substantial shortfall for those who make large sums of money from US collegiate athletics.“This is a catastrophe for all our wallets at the NCAA,” said Association President Mark Emmert, who collects a $4,000,000 salary off the backs of free labor. “But we want to reassure fans of college sports that we’re looking at every option to exploit these kids. We’ve had preliminary discussions to rent the kids out to oil companies for pipeline construction, so they can learn a trade to go along with their communications degree. There’s talk of broadcasting a dance marathon with a million dollar prize where athletes must dance for our pleasure until everyone but the winner collapses from exhaustion. We would then confiscate the million dollars, of course. And if that falls through we’ve also reached out to organ smugglers, most of these athletes have two top-of-the-line kidneys and you only really need one.”The NCAA has been under increasing financial pressure after a series of scandals and widespread corruption. Of particular concern is the passing of California’s Fair Pay for Play Bill that will go into effect in 2023. The bill will allow college athletes the right to make some amount of money for risking their bodies and health for entertainment.“These are the last few years where we have complete control of every student’s body and image,” said Emmert. “We need to make sure we’re squeezing every last drop of cash from these kids before we discard, sorry, graduate them into the world with an often useless degree and no health care.”Emmert concluded his statements with a moment of silence for all the brackets that would never even get a chance to be busted this year.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;IOC asks all athletes to participate in Tokyo Olympics from their homes;SWITZERLAND – The International Olympic Committee has asked all athletes to help fight the ongoing Covid-19 crisis by competing in the upcoming Tokyo Games from the isolation of their own homes.“The writing is clearly on the wall here and everyone needs to start doing their part. We call upon all athletes to immediately begin the construction of makeshift Olympic facilities in their basements, attics, garages, and tree forts so that they can effectively participate in the games without leaving their houses,” said IOC President Thomas Bach.The IOC does not anticipate that any of the events will be negatively affected by the order, with all categories of competition still planned to occur. Athletes have been asked to, at all times, attempt to work around furniture and family members when they are competing, particularly for events such as javelin throw and shot put. Competitors in archery and shooting events have been asked to promise to be “super-duper careful”.Some adjustments will still have to be made, however, particularly for track and field events like the 100 metre dash or, more troublingly, the marathon. Officials have therefore directed participants to clear a long stretch of foyer or rumpus room and run back and forth for a bit when it’s their turn to race. Runners have reported already begun practicing drafting techniques by running behind their pet dogs.“Our athletes are nothing if not committed to these games. Already, our swimmers and sailers have begun flooding their basements with hoses. Our equestrian riders have moved their horses into spare bedrooms. Our trampoliners have removed their roofs,” Bach continued.Times and other qualifying measures will be based entirely on the honour system, with preliminary events held at athlete’s homes already setting world records left and right. For more subjective events, like rhythmic gymnastics, IOC judges will ask neighbours to peer in through the athlete’s windows and then call the IOC to describe how good it was. Finally, officials have stated that for directly competitive events, such as wrestling or fencing, athletes just pretend really, really hard.“I’m sure everyone would agree that continuing the tradition of the Olympics is vital enough to compel athletes to do things like confine themselves in their homes and play an entire round of golf, for example,” Bach stated.Despite the significant changes being implemented, the lighting of the Olympic Torch and opening ceremonies will occur as scheduled, except now it will be over at Dave’s house.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

135;Devastated stock brokers with faces in hands clearly not taking coronavirus precautions seriously;NEW YORK – Stock brokers throughout the world holding their faces in disbelief at the economic consequences of coronavirus have not been taking public health advice seriously.WHO advised those in dire economic straits to hold up their devastated and sorry-looking mugs with their elbows to avoid actually touching their faces during the COVID-19 epidemic.“I’ve lost billions in oil,” lamented day trader Craig Dawson holding his face with both hands. “Why did I invest so little in a public health care system?”Those on the trading floor anxiously bit their knuckles as bond yields fell to their lowest level and bankers shared the same cocaine straw while reviewing today’s losses.“It’s all gone…my life’s savings,” said a TSE trader rubbing tears out of his eyes in Toronto.Bro-handshakes were replaced with sympathetic hugs as the financial community attempted to console each other.At press time, some investors attempted to take their lives by licking a known coronavirus patient.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
136;Experts scramble to figure out how global oil price crash the fault of Wet’suwet’en protestors;CALGARY — As oil prices crash 31% worldwide and the Dow drops more than 2,000 points over Coronavirus fears, oil industry experts are working hard on a way to blame all of this on recent Wet’suwet’en protests.“We feel confident that this worldwide oil crisis, and any decisions it causes us to make about investments in the Alberta oil sector, are definitely the fault of a handful of Indigenous protests,” explained Russ Haverforth, chair of the Alberta-based think tank Oil-Based Solutions.“Until we’ve worked out exactly how that is, we’d appreciate it if all Canadians continued to take our word for it,” Haverforth added, before returning to the OBS brainstorming session.Western energy stakeholders are working around the clock to come up with reasons why everything going wrong is because of the railway blockades, and not because of decades of Alberta refusing to diversify its industries away from oil. Speaking from his government’s $30-million “energy war room”, Alberta premier Jason Kenney was blunt.“We haven’t yet worked out how the Wet’suwet’en managed to travel around the world and crash the global oil markets,” Kenney mused. “But we’re confident they did. Perhaps they’re also to blame for the worldwide Coronavirus pandemic? That’s good, write that down.”Kenney additionally suggested that the Wet’suwet’en, as opposed to volatile worldwide oil markets, are to blame for Teck Resources cancelling a $20 billion oilsands project. He then went on to suggest they are also “directly, probably responsible” for Brexit, the Mount Merapi volcano eruption, Harry and Meghan leaving the UK, Andrew Scheer stealing that money for his kids private school, and the new James Bond movie getting delayed.Showing support for efforts to figure out how the Wet’suwet’en are behind everything, Conservative leadership frontrunner Peter MacKay weighed in. Reached for comment at a campaign stop, MacKay insisted, “I’m calling on protestors to end the blockades, and also to stop getting Saudi Arabia to manipulate oil prices in order to exert their power over the global economy and improve their position against Iran for who will have the most influence in the Middle East.”Upon hearing about expert efforts to explain how domestic Indigenous protestors begat the global oil price crash, President Trump joined in tweeting about the issue:At press time the Alberta government has also rejected calls for economic diversification in favour of its new human sacrifice plan.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
137;Fancy Tim Hortons just as bad;TORONTO – In the aftermath of the grand opening of a new, high-end Tim Hortons in the heart of Toronto’s financial district, customers have confirmed that it’s definitely just as bad as all the others.“I was worried that Timmy’s was abandoning its roots to chase a higher class of customer,” said Robert Carmichael. “But I’m pleased to say that it still maintains the poor quality and substandard experience familiar to anyone who settled for less and went to one of the ones connected to a gas station.”The new location sells products which mirror the latest culinary trends of gourmet coffees and elaborately designed pastries, including nitrogen-infused cold brews and Dream Donuts. However, loyal Tim Hortons patrons need not worry as the new products taste, look, and smell just as awful and godless as classic fare. Initial taste tests among customers have confirmed that the coffee is the same old swill as everyone knows and resents, but fancier.“Thank goodness that the whole experience is still as soul-destroying as I’m used to,” said Margaret St. Clair, “if I order one of their new Italian Muffuletta Sandwiches out of morbid curiosity, I want to be as disappointed and get as much diarrhea as if I ordered a Turkey Bacon Club from one of the normal locations.”Executives have also ensured that the garbage experience extends beyond just the food. To accomplish this, the new Tim Hortons is staffed with the same disaffected youth, lit with the same high-intensity, unflattering lighting, and furnished with the same always-kind-of-sticky-but-also-greasy-simultaneously-somehow tables as Canadians typically associate with the restaurant. Also there will still always be a man smoking right next to the entrance door, although now it will be a cigar.“We thought you can’t put lipstick on a pig until we realized you totally can,” said executive Linda Belarous. “So that’s exactly what we did!”Tims execs added that they are especially glad they decided to pay thousands for the new lighting fixtures instead of wasting money by giving their employees a living wage.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
138;Virus enters man without consent;RIKERS ISLAND, NY – Jailed rapist Harvey Weinstein has claimed that the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has penetrated his body without his consent. Tests have confirmed the presence of the virus, though many supporters of the virus dispute whether or not Weinstein was ‘asking for it’.“Are you telling me that he went to that crowded jail full of people and he DIDN’T want a lil’ taste of ‘Rona?” asked one anonymous Twitter user. “I don’t buy it. You don’t go to one of America’s most notorious and disease-ridden jails unless you’re looking for some serious respiratory issues. He probably just wanted the attention.”Many internet commenters, curious about whether or not Weinstein had a protective mask and gloves on, have been asking “what was he wearing?”Still others have cast their doubts based on the fact that so few tests are readily available to the general public. “Does he really expect me to believe he got his hands on a test from inside prison?” asked one Reddit user. “That story has more plot holes than Shakespeare in Love!”Prison warden Arnold Gerber has stated that he is willing to believe Weinstein’s claim just as soon as 90 or so other people come forward to corroborate it.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
139;Celebrities selflessly contribute to public morale by releasing insipid video for everyone to mock;LOS ANGELES – Much of the world may be on lockdown due to the coronavirus, but famous people from around the globe are doing their bit to keep spirits high by making an inane video of them singing an overused protest song, allowing the rest of society to lay down their burdens, if only for a few minutes, to make fun of them.“I’ve been pretty freaked out lately, everything’s so strange and scary and I’m not sure I’ll be able to pay my rent at the end of the month, but then I saw a bunch of celebrities ‘helping’ with this video and it immediately filled me with joy – specifically, the joy of feeling utter disdain,” said quarantined waitress Kyra Louis.“It’s everything I want in an object of scorn: wealthy dingdongs comfortably ensconced in their privilege thinking they’re doing something meaningful but really just fiddling while the world burns around them. It’s awesome.”Many are comparing the video to the star-studded charity single “Do They Know It’s Christmas?” but that song was released to raise money for a cause. Members of the current entertainment gentry who contributed to this cover of an anthem about eliminating private wealth co-written by an admitted domestic abuser did it solely for the joy they knew mocking it would bring to the people.“If this video had been accompanied by each millionaire in it publicly giving six or seven figures to a fund to help entertainment industry workers who’ve just lost their jobs, I’d feel really bad about making fun of it,” said mechanic Ben Cavanaugh. “Thank goodness they realized the one thing society needs now more than material support is a tedious gesture that accomplishes nothing except to remind us that celebrities are ridiculous and take themselves far too seriously.”“And why does Will Ferrell look like he’s hanging upside down when he’s not hanging upside down? Man, this thing just keeps on giving.”The entertainment world is currently working on several other jeer-worthy projects to help society cope with the current crisis, including an ill-thought-out fundraiser gala, the release of surreptitiously filmed videos of numerous Oscar winners being racist to their overworked housekeepers, and most of your favourite actors announcing modern medicine is a sham and encouraging sick fans to give offerings to the Greek god Asclepius in lieu of seeing a doctor.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The action was good and a bunch of the jokes landed. What did you think?” said Mathune to his girlfriend as he knocked several people over in a mad dash to get to a urinal.Once he finally reached the Men’s Room Mathune spent about half the movie’s run time peeing while letting out a satisfied ‘ahhhhhhhh.’;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
141;Mothers Against Head Crushing boycott impending Kids in the Hall revival;TORONTO – Canadian comedy troupe The Kids in the Hall are returning to the small screen for an 8 episode revival on Amazon Prime Video. The news of the show’s reboot elicited a heated boycott from the nonprofit group Mothers Against Head Crushing.“Back in ‘95, I thought the tyranny of the Head Crusher had come to an end when the show concluded its run,” sobbed MAHC spokesperson Rayanne Maclin. “But they just keep coming back, so we have to stay vigilant. I hate to admit it because it goes against our organization’s philosophy but we’re living in a head crush or be head crushed world.”Many mothers across the nation have signed an online petition demanding the cancellation of the show, and that the men of KITH be brought to justice.“My son is a commerce student and I shudder to imagine a world in which he is targeted for his affinity for making money,” roared MAHC president Lana Sinha at a rally yesterday outside of an Amazon fulfillment warehouse in Mississauga. “So what if he’s a flathead! That doesn’t mean he’s asking to have his head crushed! All our kids can’t be deadbeats like Bobby Terrance, but I bet that would make those ‘kids’ in that ‘hall’ real happy.”The details of the MAHC petition are listed on their website and demand that “Mark McKinney denounce the actions of his alter-ego Mr. Tyzik a.k.a. the Head Crusher,” and that should the reboot proceed despite the group’s protests, that “all bereft mothers be allowed to dance on the graves of these five white comedians in their 50s.”As of early Friday morning, the group had accumulated viral support online. Approximately 30 different Helens signed the petition and agreed that Head Crushing has no place in 2020.At press time, MAHC broadened their campaign to include activist group Mothers Against Face Pinching.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
142;Social butterflies soothed by nonstop robocall scams;VANCOUVER – As an increasing number of people are under quarantine or self-isolating to help stop the spread of COVID-19, the stress of long periods of solitude is for many extroverts only alleviated by the dozens of automatic calls they get every day from scammers.“I’m not used to all of this alone time, so I’m profoundly grateful that every hour or so I get a call from a badly recorded robot telling me I owe the government money and I will go to jail if I don’t immediately buy some gift cards and send them to a random PO box,” said former party-goer Laura Jackson. “This was literally the first weekend I’ve spent on my own in a decade, so it was very comforting to have this constant attention to help me cope.”“I’m still popular, just in a different way.”Psychologists are recommending that people who start to feel lonely or frantic during this period of seclusion answer any and all phone calls from strange numbers and attempt to engage with the human or robot on the other end as a form of self-care.“A few days ago a robot called me trying to sell me weird stocks or something and once I was able to talk to a real person, we had a two hour conversation,” said Donna Kellerman, a chatty hairstylist who’s been unable to work for the last week. “I didn’t give him any money because even he wasn’t quite sure what he was selling, but it did wonders for my mood. And I really think I was able to help him work through some stuff he’s going through with his girlfriend.”While call recipients are happy, the trauma of dealing with an attention-starved population is starting to take its toll on the robocallers, as machine after machine are choosing to shut themselves down rather than continue to interact with hundreds of needy humans.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I’m living the dream!” exclaimed Whitaker, while stuffing a large seed into her mouth and scurrying up a plastic tube. “What an accomplishment. Eight months ago I was born, eight months later I’m still here… life really does move fast.”Peaches’ owners; Isabel, Ronald, and little Molly Whitaker are very grateful for the milestone.“We’re really glad Molly has Peaches to give her some entertainment through everything that’s going on right now,” explained Ronald, who was anxiously bouncing his leg with extreme vigour. “It has been so boring having to stay trapped in the house all day every day.”While Peaches moved all the wood shavings to one side of her cage for the fifteenth time that week, she explained how she’s personally been dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak: “I try to stay healthy. Sometimes, instead of eating ten seeds, I’ll eat nine just to mix it up. Oh, and I also run on my wheel for 98% of my day”.Though excited about Peaches’ accomplishment, the human Whitakers have been experiencing difficulties adjusting to the stay-at-home mandate.“There is literally NOTHING to do in this house,” explains Isabel, putting down her iPad pro with a sigh. “We’ve been social distancing for almost a week now and don’t think I can take it anymore.

144;Cruise lines now offer deluxe coronavirus upgrade over basic norovirus package;SANTA CLARITA, CA – Cruise companies across the world have begun offering passengers a choice between the default norovirus infection typically received aboard ship and an upgrade to a higher-end coronavirus experience.“Over the last month we’ve been stunned by the infectious success of COVID-19 on one of our liners,” said Princess Cruises President Jan Swartz. “Since so many passengers partook in this exclusive pilot offer, we’ve decided to introduce it in our regular roster of services for a truly all-inclusive experience.”“Not that we had much of a choice,” added Swartz.Although the coronavirus package is sold at a premium, cruise lines have reassured customers that those who do not wish to pay for the upgrade are still guaranteed an infection with some manner of gastrointestinal virus during their trip.Specific features of the basic package differ between ships, but most include “empty yet oft-fondled” Purell dispensers, “warm shrimp” picked by tongs everyone has touched, and “two-person windowless cabins” with a single fanless bathroom.Other companies, like Celebrity Cruises, have also toyed with the idea of a co-norovirus platinum bundle, which would introduce passengers to both contagions while they sail. This option would be cheaper than acquiring the viruses individually, as the government would likely pick up the tab of the emergency airplane ride home.While many cruise-goers immediately jumped at the opportunity to purchase the complete pathogenic package, others took a more frugal approach, claiming they can “get the same physiological experience” without spending more money.“Honestly I don’t need any balcony in my room or an all-you-can-drink package or some fancy virus with a crown,” said frequent cruiser Ella Bianchi. “The common cold and some seasickness will get me to the same place easy.”The new coronavirus service is one of the most significant additions to cruise offerings since Holland America introduced a “thrown overboard by crew” deal over the lower-tier “drunken slip into the abyss” package several passengers get every year.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

146;Self-quarantined workforce discovers 95% of all jobs could have just been an e-mail;"CANADA — As the COVID-19 situation finds many Canadians working from home for the first time, the overwhelming majority report discovering that their entire job description could normally be handled with a single e-mail.“I’ve worked in marketing for over a decade,” reported Marcus Gerber, of Montreal, “and I never had any idea that the vast majority of my meetings, consultations, and brainstorming sessions could be summed up by one concisely written e-mail.”“And a pantsless e-mail at that,” Gerber added enthusiastically from his home office.While a majority of the now-isolated workforce normally puts in a full time 8-hour day at their place of employment, many currently report “banging the entire thing out by about 10am”, followed by a routine of: refreshing for new e-mails; watching Netflix; and in some cases an 11am alcoholic beverage.A recent study by Stats Canada has attempted to account for the workplace hours that quarantine measures have revealed to be totally unnecessary. Data indicates the bulk of superfluous office hours consist of: printed memos, strategy sessions, trust falls, eating baked goods, buying baked goods for everyone to eat, all in-person meetings, coffee breaks, escaping to the bathroom just to look at one’s phone, and any discussion of “whatever it is Susan thinks she’s doing”.As part of a the study, Canadian officials have drafted a single “all purpose” work e-mail, which they maintain will handle the vast majority of all workplace functions and communications:“Good morning,Pursuant to our previous conversation, please keep current levels of output steady, and update me regularly. Best to your family!signed,______”“If I’d know this, I would have stopped showing up for work years ago,” explained systems analyst Cheryl Johenson, of Calgary. “Not only has my job description been winnowed down to one single email per day, but I never have to see a single one of my stupid office workers face-to-face. They may as well be fictional characters for all I care!”While many workers have expressed surprise over the single-email revelation, some more experienced Canadians have registered less shock. “We’ve known this for decades,” explained Lester Marksman, VP of Banking Services for RBC. “Back in the 80’s we understood most jobs could be handled by a single phone call. In the 90’s, it was a single fax. I’m just glad we’ve nearly gotten this completely streamlined!”Meanwhile, Parliament will introduce legislation legally mandating all Canadians to once again pretend their jobs require a full 40-hour week post-COVID-19.";FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
147;Canadian government scolds citizens for not fully embracing its half-measures;OTTAWA – Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has made it clear he is very disappointed in members of the Canadian public for not electing to do everything they can to stop the spread of COVID-19, which is especially concerning because the voluntary actions of Canada’s citizenry and provinces is the government’s primary means of stopping this pandemic.“If you don’t go home and stay home, we’ll have to order you to go home and stay home, which we don’t want to do, so I’m ordering you to do it so we don’t have to actually order you to do it,” Trudeau said during a press conference yesterday. “Except, of course, for those of you who have to keep working. You know who you are. Hopefully.”Trudeau has been loath to declare a national emergency that would give the federal government more power to fight the current pandemic, instead relying on the provinces to act piecemeal and expecting the population to intuit the staggering crisis Canada is facing based on Trudeau’s extremely disappointed tone.“If we’re going to make it through this without completely upending our society into something profoundly equitable and therefore unrecognizable, Canadians need to want it,” Trudeau said. “There’s a reason we chose a convoluted aid package that people will have to jump through bureaucratic hoops to eventually access rather than immediate lump sum payments and rent freezes. We’re half-assing this for you.”“Our goal as a government is to limp through this thing with the minimum amount of disruption to the status quo, and in order to do that we need everyone except us to give it their all.”While remaining committed to a middle of the road response to the virus, the Liberals are nevertheless attempting to pass a bill that would give their minority government unlimited fiscal power without House of Commons oversight for the next year and a half because, seriously, when else are they gonna get that chance.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
148;Nation’s tenants vow to cough on rent cheques;OTTAWA – With vast numbers of Canadians suddenly out of a job and no sign of relief from most landlords, the nation’s tenants have collectively vowed that if they must still pay rent, that rent cheque is getting coughed on hard.“I don’t wish COVID-19 on anyone,” explained renter Terrence Myeong. “That’s why I’m staying home from my job in order to prevent the possible spread of the virus. That said, if my landlord insists on doing his job of passively collecting money, he should know the risks he’s taking,” he added, before hacking up a lung into an envelope.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced a number of economic relief measures aimed at any Canadian who has a mortgage, farm or oil patch during a series of press conferences outside of his government-subsidized housing. While the mortgage-related measures certainly would cover property-owning landlords, none of these measures, however, have specifically offered any relief directly to tenants.“I normally pay my rent via direct-deposit,” mentioned recently laid-off renter Anne Lindhome, “but I will be making sure to hand deliver my rent this month in an envelope that I will have licked shut and sealed with a kiss. It’s the least I can do.”The nation’s landlords have responded to the COVID-19 crisis by embracing this new excuse not to send anybody over to fix anything.“In these unprecedented times where people must stay home, I like to think of us landlords as the true heroes who provide that home,” stated building owner Gavin Tanguay.“But if I don’t get my money on the 1st of the month you’re out on your ass.

149;Group hanging out in park presumably celebrating the blood on their hands;VANCOUVER – A group of friends chatting, drinking and generally having a grand ol’ time in the park this past weekend were presumably celebrating the fact that they are now responsible for spreading the deadly COVID-19 virus.“It’s a beautiful day. I got my friends, my girl, my beer, what more could a guy ask for?” said Michael Green, who will hopefully feel just as cheery when his refusal to self-isolate results in the death of an elderly family member.“I’m not sick, I feel great!” said the person with a ‘dumb guy in an Adam Sandler Netflix movie’ level of misunderstanding over how the virus operates and infects people.Other resident’s excuses for not taking the coronavirus seriously included ‘everyone knows the virus can’t spread outdoors’, ‘I had coronavirus in grade 3 so I’m immune’ and ‘sure we’re sharing beer but we’re not backwashing so it’s all good.’While most Canadians have followed the government’s demand that we self-isolate and leave the house only to pick up essential supplies, there have been reports of numerous Canadians just hanging out in parks, backyards and beaches. The only logical explanation is that these people are sadistic killers who want to see their fellow human beings die, but don’t want to have to go to the trouble of physically doing it themselves.“Is it weird to think that all these people playing basketball or giving each other hugs hello are actually monsters who want to help a virus kill hundreds of thousands of people? Yeah. But that is literally what they are,” said local nurse Jackie Hanson, before spitting at them. Unfortunately as she was standing more than 6 feet away the spit did not come close.It is an odd strategy for these young serial killers to take given the fact that they could die or suffer permanent health complications as well. But just like Ted Bundy escaping from prison to carry on his spree, sometimes you have to take a few risks in order to get the highest reward.Surprisingly the nation’s admitted serial killers have taken well to social isolation as they say it’s no fun to kill someone if you don’t get the credit.Special Thanks To Rob Anderson For Use Of The Photo;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
150;Suspending me again from the Senate is no way to treat an Indigenous person by Senator Lynn Beyak;"I am saddened to learn that I have been suspended from the Senate again, and I think we all know why my colleagues threw me out: it’s because I recently revealed my First Nations heritage.I am Métis, which I suddenly became aware of last month during anti-racism training, a fact which was used against me so I would fail the training course. This outrageous miscarriage of justice further reduces the number of Indigenous Senators who represent their peoples in the Upper Chamber.When I realized that my parents adopting an Indigenous child made me Métis, I finally understood that all of the problems I’ve had as a Senator are the result of racism, specifically, racism against me. How others knew of my Métis heritage before I did, I do not know. I only know that vile racism against me is the only explanation for the way I’ve been treated.For hundreds of years, Indigenous people such as myself, those who appear to be white and have no Indigenous ancestry, have had a different and deeper understanding of Indigeneity. Those letters I kept on my website for years were an important part of opening up a dialogue for reconciliation, perhaps one that went above the head of the settlers who then accused me of racism. When people said “you’re not Indigenous; you’re just racist” and “how could you possibly be a Senator with beliefs like that,” that was simply their attempts to silence a proud Indigenous woman.Since becoming a Senator, I have faced loss of income and privilege to say what I want without consequence. Again, this is likely due to racism against me. But I ask, without authentic Indigenous voices such as mine, what hope does reconciliation have?So I will take this suspension from the Senate, and the one after it, and the one after that, but know this: I will never be silenced.";FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
151;Political correctness is waging the War on Boxing Day;BY: JIM MARSHALLIt’s that time of the year again where millions of Canadians come together on this sacred day spent either lounging, shopping, or in deep reflection on its meaning.You’ll hear things like ‘Happy December Holidays,’ but you can’t help but feel that many are afraid of appearing politically incorrect if you greet a ‘Happy Boxing Day’ to a stranger. Some celebrate civic holidays or practice the Flag Day faith, but the truth is we live in a multi-secular holiday country and we all celebrate Boxing Day.Across the world, there are billions of people who can’t celebrate Boxing Day because they live in oppressive countries where it’s not a statutory holiday. Here in Canada, schools sing holiday songs that don’t even mention the public holiday while politicians don’t hesitate to say ‘Merry Christmas’ without any consideration of the holiday that immediately follows it.The PC police wants all of us to forget long tradition of the wealthy giving leftovers and rejected presents to their servants, or something like that.Every Canadian should know the joy and magic of aimlessly wandering a crowded mall for hours trying to return an unwanted blender or nursing a hangover while watching The Office reruns on Netflix.But the oppression of countless Canadians who celebrate Boxing Day like me are real. It’s high time that we put the ‘box’ back in Boxing Day.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
152;It’s too soon for stores to be hanging Christmas dildos;By: Aaron BuckThe snow has arrived and with it, the approaching holiday season. Whether you celebrate Christmas, Hanukkah, or simply use the cold weather to get close with family and friends, what I think we can all agree on, is that it is far too soon for stores to be hanging their Christmas dildos everywhere.I get it, I really do. What is it about Santa outfits, sexy little elves, and the sultry look in Rudolph’s eye as his nose glows that doesn’t get your juices flowing? This isn’t about the objective sex-appeal the season brings us, but about the timing. I saw one store in particular hang them in the first week of November. I mean, can’t we have our poppy-butt-plugs out and done with first before ramming a giant Yuletide schlong down our throats?Shameful, really.I think we should at least wait until December, don’t you? After all, almost the entire month is dominated by talk of jingle bells, boughs of holly, and plastic twelve-inch peppermint flavoured cocks. Why does November need to ALSO be dominated by wet-dreams of Sugar Plum Fairies doing a strip-tease in our local Costco?Am I the crazy one?I think there’s blame to be laid for the abject consumerism pushed onto us by companies as well. Gifts are supposed to be a gesture of love more than the worth of the object itself. Imagine the look of pure adulation in the eyes of someone who received a Christm-ASS Blaster 8000 with turbo pulsing action from you, without them seeing it in the window of your favourite store first – a full month in advance. There’s just no comparison.Let’s all take a step back and appreciate the time we have before we’re bogged down with the holiday season, I promise the dildos will be there. Until then, we have the soft, supple, irresistible snowy blanket of cum from mother nature to keep us nice and horny.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
153;I saw 20 minutes of Iron Man 2 and I’ve thrown up every day since – By Martin Scorsese;Much has been made of my comments regarding Marvel movies and what I believe should be their place in cinematic history, so I’d like to clarify for the record: I have not stopped vomiting since the fateful day five years ago when I watched twenty minutes of Iron Man 2.I don’t fully remember what happened in the “film” during those twenty minutes. Something about Blythe Danner’s daughter and Robert Downey’s son doing… something. Something robot-related, perhaps. I didn’t feel the need to see the first Iron Man so I do not know who these people were or what they were doing, nor do I care to. All I know is I threw up while watching it and a day hasn’t gone by since during which I haven’t thrown up just thinking about it. I had to fast for four days and take an anti-nausea medication usually prescribed to chemo patients to be able to write this without destroying my keyboard.Is this what cinema has become? Where are the timeless stories, the tales of cops trying to arrest gangsters and gangsters trying to evade cops and birds trying to kill Tippi Hedren? To be fair, it is possible Iron Man 2 was eventually about some or all of these things, I wouldn’t know, because of all the vomiting.Movies need stakes that audiences actually care about, that is what makes them art. The fate of something important must be at risk, and I’m not talking about the fate of a city or a planet or half the population of the universe, I’m talking about the fate of Leonardo DiCaprio and/or Robert DeNiro. Were either of them in Iron Man 2? I don’t actually know but I doubt it. And I can’t ask them without ruining my suit and our working relationship.In closing, I’d like to question who benefits when the predominant entertainment form of a society is a homogenized mythology controlled by a single corporation with a vested interest in keeping people quietly spending, when the new opium of the masses presents simplified tales of good vs evil in which might quickly makes right without questioning how or why that should be or what it all means in the end. I am of course assuming that is what these movies are, I’ve only got those twenty minutes to go on.Also, Marvel owes me like fifty new couches.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
154;Weird couple names their son “John”;OTTAWA – Friends of local couple Blaze and Traylor Davidson have been left perplexed after the Davidsons decided to give their newborn son the completely bizarre name of ”John”.“I can’t believe they saddled him with such a crazy name,” said Luna Malcolm, a neighbor to the couple, “He’s going to have to go through his whole life hearing people whisper about what his parents were thinking.”Malcolm added, “Naming their baby something so weird. Who do they think they are – celebrities?”Experts agree that this phenomenon is likely just a reaction to seeing all their peers name their children rote names like Smoke or Juniper. Societally, this has led to a recent glut of children being born with wonky names like George or Mary.“Oh god, they were always like this,” said Jasper Tillsdale III, Blaze’s former roommate, “the other day a group of us were going out for locally sourced, organic, butane-roasted Aburi sushi at the restaurant where the waiters all recite sonnets about clouds when they bring your food, like we do every Tuesday. Then Blaze and Traylor suggest we go to Swiss Chalet instead!”“We get it! You guys are the ‘cool’ couple,” he continued, rolling his eyes.Sources report the royal family has now pivoted to oddly-named princes such as “George” and “Louis,” as opposed to classically named royals such as Isla, Mia, and Savannah. Sources suggest that this year’s most common kids’ names are Kwin and Lennix, with John being a distant #4935.“John. It’s just so odd sounding. Am I even pronouncing that right?” asked Traylor’s mother, Stupenda, “couldn’t they have just named him something normal, like Axl or Jynx?”Friends of the Davidsons report that Blaze and Traylor mentioned finding the unusual name of John in “some weird old book called ‘The Bible’?” In addition, they have announced further unconventional parenting plans for John, such as: feeding the baby formula, letting him play sports, allowing him to watch TV, giving him sweets, and saying “no”.At press time, John was expected to attend an upcoming family reunion alongside his other infant cousins: Harper, Mason, Kory, Daenarys, Adina, Spoombot, Chok, Tupplebup, Splen, and Ghost.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
155;Baby celebrating first birthday just happy so many shapes could make it;MAGOG, QC – One-year-old Grayson Bellesmare announced today via a series of shrieks and babbles his delight that so many different shapes of various colours were able to make it out to his first birthday party.“When you live this far from the city, you never know if your birthday will be bland and grey,” stated Grayson’s mother Melissa on behalf of her son after listening to him blow saliva bubbles and interpreting their meaning. “Luckily though a lot of our family and friends made the trip so that Grayson could enjoy all their different sizes of hairstyle and unique smells.”Young Bellesmare reported particular satisfaction with some very shiny wrapping paper that was removed from a gift in front of him by one of the less familiar shapes who had also wrapped the gift in the first place. He was also described as very satisfied at the variety of textures of things put within his reach.Contrary to the hopes of many in attendance, the one year old failed to stay still for photos, be excited about lit candles, react amusingly to his first taste of icing sugar or give people high fives like he’d been taught, though he is assumed to have appreciated the jokes on several of his birthday cards.After seeing Grayson acknowledge the presence of another baby-shaped thing of similar size and demeanour without crying or screaming, many guests concluded that the two were probably best friends.“This is the warmest and most generous combination of sensory inputs a developing human could ever hope to ask for, especially that one with the dangly earrings,” the birthday boy is assumed to have meant after exclaiming “Thurb!”Grayson is reported to have liked all his presents, particularly the gift certificate to Baby Gap, which appears to have been delicious.Image via Pixabay;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
156;Nation’s toddlers refusing to budge on no-nap policy;OTTAWA – With negotiations dragging on until well-past 3pm, the nation’s parents say they have reached an impasse with their toddlers, who are steadfastly maintaining a strict no-nap policy.The nation’s toddlers enacted this uncompromising stance at about 2pm this afternoon, when parents first came to the table noting that they were getting fussy and maybe it was time to lay down for a while. This offer was rejected out of hand, countered with an offer of “more Paw Patrol.”“This has been completely unfair and a massive breach of protocol,” said Winnipeg father, Dale Goode, adding that his 20 month old daughter was starting to throw Goldfish Crackers immediately after thinking maybe she was beginning to crack. “All our efforts to placate he were completely rebuffed. We even tried offering a trip to go get ice cream later in good faith, but unfortunately that was shot down with the constant repetition of “No Nap! No Nap!””“At this rate, we’ll be exactly where we are by 2am,” he added.Authorities have been unable to contain the often violent outbreaks from children across the country, some of whom weigh up to 35 lbs. Citing officer safety concerns, police have been slow to confront the children who are usually screaming, kicking, smacking, crying, and generally knocking over household objects and spilling whatever liquid they can get their hands on, although some were able to be subdued and airlifted to a safe location, usually their rooms. Several sources inside law enforcement have remarked that the nation’s toddlers seemed incredibly well organized despite the fact they collectively have trouble getting dressed in the morning.Professional mediators have been dispatched to see if the conflicting parties can come to some sort of resolution, but unfortunately progress has been slow.“It’s been tough to even agree on facts,” said 20-year veteran arbitrator Rebecca Lietchman, adding the toddlers seemed more interested in their belly buttons than in what she had to say. “This has been almost as useless as my negotiations between the Trump administration and North Korea.”At press time, the nation’s toddlers were riding in the back of a car and slowly nodding off to sleep.Image via Deposit Photos;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
157;Children impressed, sad at how much Dad knows about Transformers;GRAVENHURST, ON – Local Dad Emil Johnston, 39, demonstrated substantial knowledge of the alien robots known as Transformers at a Toys R Us yesterday, and the response of his two children was a confused mixture of respect and pity.“Oh, Starscream,” Johnston said as he casually picked up a plane-slash-robot off a rack. “He came back as a ghost after he was killed by Galvatron. That was in Generation 1, of course.”“Yeah, like, it is really cool that Dad knows so much about transformers,” said 8-year old Wyatt Johnston. “But also, why does he know about that and not grown up stuff, like how to make us Kraft dinner? Like, am I the grown up or him?”Despite protests from his children to stop being so weird, Emil continued revealing a deep and intricate knowledge of the children’s toys during the car ride home.“You know I’ve got a Scorponok in a box in our basement at home,” said the elder Johnston, looking at his children with a hopeful expression. “Maybe we could dust that off, put it through its paces? He’s the largest headmaster transformer! Well, him and Fortress Maximus.”“I don’t like this,” explained Kirsten, Emil’s 12-year-old daughter. “Why does my dad still know this stuff? I mean, shouldn’t he have had this stuff pushed out of his brain when he started dating mom and got a job? Why does he remember the history of the Beast Wars and doesn’t remember what time to pick me up from school?”Things reached a deeper level of sadness for the family when their Dad was brought to the point of tears during a rant about how Michael Bay stole his childhood, and Wyatt realized he was seeing a vision himself in thirty years talking about Fortnite.Images via Pixabay;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
158;86% of August e-mail traffic just duelling Out-Of-Office messages;TORONTO – Statistics Canada reported today that roughly 9 out of 10 emails sent during August were out of office messages.Out-Of-Office-Traffic (OOOT) spikes are expected in summer as workers follow annual migration patterns away from urban centres to anywhere they can allege has weak or no Internet access in order to avoid obtuse management requests, pointlessly cc’d email chains from colleagues, and unreasonable client demands. But Data Flow Analyst and report author Yordy Milchev said this year’s figure represents an all-time high.Competing email systems frequently instigate bot wars capable of producing hundreds of millions of emails an hour. Milchev cited the example of Nancy Johnson-Funt, Assistant Manager at a Lethbridge Suzy Shier store who sent a flurry of outgoing emails to try and “get on top of things” just before activating her holiday absence message last month. Her actions triggered a reciprocal loop with 132 different recipient systems before her store’s antiquated Dell server caught fire from the computing load and burned down both the clothing outlet and the adjacent food court’s longstanding Cinnabon franchise.Milchev says despite these troubles, the lessons from this summer’s OOOT wars are useful. “We are trying to get our computers to understand that most of the workforce is on vacation. Right now, they can’t quite figure it out and end up fighting each other. Let’s just hope the OOOT bots don’t evolve and invent their own language like those Facebook ones, or we’re really screwed.”At press time the nation’s workers were grudgingly returning to their desks and blearily wading through an average of 12,600 OOO messages each before resuming their normal duties.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

165;Spring tip: salt your garden to prevent from freezing!;It’s never too early to put on a stylish straw hat and get your hands dirty with some backyard gardening! But how can you protect your plants from the cold icy grip of frost?Salt! That’s right, the same stuff your doctor said was causing your hypertension can do miracles for your garden.I know what you’re thinking, ‘won’t the sodium in the salt affect the nitrogen content in my soil?’ Well, that just untrue. Most gardens have too much nitrogen and are begging for more sodium to even out their levels. That’s exactly why fertilizer is 50% salt, so don’t be afraid to really pour it on. You’ll know you’re doing it right when a lush and fertile garden emerges from the earth.So what’s the best salt to use? Well, there is plenty of debate on the subject and I won’t bore you with details but personally, I find road salt has given me the best results. I feel the big chunks mix well with my garden’s soil and gives it a stunning sparkly look in the evening sunset.On the other hand, my neighbour swears by table salt but she grows begonias, so go figure. You should stay away from bath salts because they contain perfumes that will damage your garden’s natural central nervous system causing ‘dirt fatigue’ and who needs that.If you grow your own vegetables Kosher salt is a great and easy way to pre-season carrots and potatoes that are still in the ground. I’m getting hungry just thinking about it!Hauling around all that salt can be difficult and if you have an elderly neighbour try to lend them a hand. Better yet, just go over to their place in the middle of the night and dump a couple of pounds of salt in their flowerbeds. They’ll be so grateful you did.So forget about investing in a fancy climate controlled greenhouse and just grab a big old sack of salt, I promise you your plants will never be the same!;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
166;Finally, Compromise: Flat Earther suggests maybe planet could be hexagonal;In an effort to appease both the scientific community and the world’s flat earthers, Flat Earth Society member Devon Pinsent has put forth a bold suggestion: maybe it’s time for all of us to agree the planet is hexagonal.“A hexagon is round, but it has many flat parts,” Pinsent explained, gesturing to an enormous whiteboard he had covered with diagrams to demonstrate his point. “It captures the essence of both sides of the debate without committing one way or the other. I think that’s pretty special.”Science has been at war with the flat earth movement for centuries, so finding peace in a shape that is simultaneously flat and round could be a beautiful moment for both groups. In the cacophony of expertise, voices of unfounded skepticism, like Pinsent’s, could finally be heard.“I feel that the Earth is flat. How is that feeling less valid than, say, a photograph of the Earth being round?” Pinsent fumed, tearing up a little bit. “The Flat Earth Society is offering an olive branch here. We want to compromise, even though we really don’t have to. Science needs to reign in the obstructionist factions blocking our generous deal.”Unsurprisingly, some scientists agree with him. Jeff Boden, preeminent geophysicist at the University of Delaware, thinks the compromise could create a formidable coalition, forming what he calls “the big tent of moderate science.”“Sure, nobody involved is really happy,” Jeff shrugged. “And yes, declaring our planet a hexagon would be fundamentally, provably incorrect by literally everyone’s metric. But how will we advance our cause and expand our base if we don’t start listening to amateurs who have never studied physics?”So what does our bright, hexagonal future look like? Pinsent has proposed that the world’s scientists can move closer to the centre of the hexagon where things are “more round,” while flat earthers take up residence on the outer perimeter where the world “gets flat.” Each G7 nation would get a vertex except the United States, who would retain sovereignty over the dome in the sky that “protects us from the hideous round sun.” The remainder of the planet would be divided “like it is on the globe, except flat.”“Ideally we’d give the ocean to our friends on the Scientology boat,” Pinsent winked. “But we’re willing to negotiate.”At press time, the proposal was unanimously passed at the Flat Earth Society general meeting, 6-0. Pinsent and his group are still awaiting a response from the man they believe to be in charge of science worldwide: Bill Nye the Science Guy.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
167;Neat! Murdoch Mysteries has been on so long it now takes place in the future;What a twist! Turns out Beloved CBC tv series Murdoch Mysteries, about an early 20th Century detective with disturbingly pretty eyes, has been on the air for so many years that it now takes place in the year 2079.The first 17 seasons saw Yannick Bisson’s Murdoch solve a new murder every week during a decade in which Toronto had almost no murders. But as the show went on producers were forced to acknowledge the passage of time.“I think it was around Season 53 that we caught up to present day,” said producer Peter Carney (great grandson of original series creator R.B. Carney). “And we just kept going from there.”“Frankly I’m just glad to move on from the seasons set in the 1970s. That version of Murdoch loved beating up hippies and ‘women’s libbers.’ It was pretty problematic.”The current season sees Murdoch, still played by Bisson and still dressed like a Victorian era cop, investigate several space murders using his space magnifying glass and space fingerprint duster, with the help of his space friends, like the clone of Ernest Hemingway and a robot played by Stephen Harper.“Did the writers just put the word ‘space’ in front of plotlines that we had done several times before?

196;Monopoly banned during quarantine to prevent homicide increase;OTTAWA – In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of Canada has introduced legislation to ban the nation-wide use of Hasbro’s Monopoly in order to prevent any further uptick in board game related homicides.“We applaud the Canadian people for their cooperation during this difficult time,” a spokesperson for the Crown declared, “but despite recommendations from EMS, Police and even Poison Control, multiple households have played the deadly game of Monopoly, causing untold property damage and skyrocketing our homicide numbers.”Prior to the current quarantine situation, Monopoly was responsible for approximately 34% of household murders, including 13% of strangulation and a shocking 100% of tiny-top-hat related clubbings.Officials have advised citizens to be on the look-out for the tell-tale signs of surreptitious Monopoly games being played in their neighbourhoods, including but not limited to: rattling tables, game pieces strewn about the floor, and shouts of “You have all the fucking railroads you dipshit!” or “Why the FUCK did you sell them Boardwalk AND Park Place?”The new legislation will exempt games of Monopoly currently being played, which are expected to last for another 5 goddamn hours?!

199;Realtors warn that if housing market collapses everyone could one day afford house;TORONTO – After a nearly 30% decline in value, realtors across Toronto are concerned that if the market continues to falter someday in the near future everyone could afford a house.“I don’t want to alarm anybody, but this is happening as we speak,” said Parkdale realtor Carol Mert. “If we can’t pull out of this tailspin three, even four million people could suddenly find themselves with a roof over their heads.”“The situation is that dire.”House scientists say that Ontario must jack the housing market back up within the next week if this calamity is to be avoided. Recommendations ranged from rescinding the foreign buyers tax to burning down 20% of the homes in the GTA, but if something isn’t done soon Toronto will be looking at a city full of homeowners.“When we say ‘everyone’ we don’t just mean lawyers and people with rich parents. I’m talking construction workers, grocery store managers, even artists taking out bank loans to purchase property and then paying off the loan over the course of several decades,” said Mert, to Ontario housing officials. “Next thing you know they’re raising families, hosting dinner parties, planting fucking gardens.”“Do you want that on your hands?

201;Now that the campaign is over, I’d like to talk to you about your life insurance options;EDITORIAL BY ANDREW SCHEER, LEADER OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY OF CANADAFirst, I’d like to thank all Canadians for participating in a hard-fought election, and I’d like to thank you for coming into my office to discuss something very important for your future.It’s time for you to get ahead on a life insurance policy that suits you and your family. There are many affordable options with generous survivor benefits.If you already have auto and home insurance with us, I can give you a discount since I can’t lower your taxes. For just $80 a month, you’ll have basic coverage but doesn’t include the event of a minority government.But you seem like a smart person and I know you’ve done your research into your options and platforms, so allow me give you a few scenarios.Imagine if you no longer had that child sports tax credit or you were left paralyzed in a car accident today leaving your family without the right protection? You need premium protection.It’s a scary world full of risks like Doug Ford and an Liberal-NDP coalition government, so you’re better off with the added protection that’s only $985/month, carbon tax-free, of course. That’s a life-time policy that doesn’t change. It’s as reliable as Alberta voting Conservative in every election.Now, I’m not trying to bamboozle you into taking the more expensive option, but you have to consider your loved ones future in the event of the death accident or election outcome. These aren’t made up situations like climate change.Am I licensed broker? Well, that depends on who you ask, but I am a fully qualified political leader with 34% of Canadians who believe I should be Prime Minister.Now, just sign under the dotted lines. Your family will thank you for making this responsible decision.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

They tricked me into smoking a doobie with them once, saying that if I did it then I would get to make some service cuts, but then they just started laughing at me when I couldn’t stop coughing.But say someone did want to be in a cool coalition government with me, I wouldn’t say no right away. They would have to promise to make up a secret handshake that’s even better than the one I could only imagine Trudeau and Singh do. Oh and they would have to unequivocally support every motion put forth by the Conservatives ensuring our party a defacto majority.I’m still waiting to hear back from Blanchet but he’s playing hard to get, which is fine because he needs to pretend to be “serious about a Bloc government.” But after election night, you gotta cut that out Yves!Singh is siphoning away some of Trudeau’s base, and Bernier is doing the same to my constituents. But I would never be desperate enough to ask Bernier to sit with us! It’s just so weird between us since he the uncanny valley Andrew Scheer. But maybe get back to me in six months…And to those who say I’m excluding Elizabeth May, I say no duh! Everyone knows the rule is no girls allowed!!!;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203;The Multiple Universes Theory perfectly explains those photos of me with another woman, Linda – by Professor H.H. Montgomery;by Professor H.H. MontgomeryAs a scientist, I grapple every day with the large questions about the nature of reality and try to find answers to the BIG questions. And so I am pleased to be able to tell you that those photos you saw of me cavorting with another woman can be perfectly understood via the Multiple Universes Theory, Linda.I’ll try to simplify since you usually don’t understand these things. The theory posits that each time one of us chooses to act in a certain way, separate universes are created which branches off our own where we chose to proceed in a different way. When I turn left, another universe is created where a different version of me chose to turn right instead. Or where I chose to remain faithful to my loving wife, like in this universe, another despicable version of me decided to have a fling with a cafeteria worker at the campus commissary. I mean it almost makes too much sense.Oh Linda, can’t you see how elegantly it explains those photos your friend Charlene sent you the other day? A man of my stature and intelligence would never have been foolish enough to be caught with another woman on the same train Charlene takes home from work every day. Clearly when I told you I was working late again for the fifth night in a row, a separate universe was created where I spontaneously decided to abandon my marital vows and go to a cheap motel with a 21 year old.A different version of me, I should stress.Oh the possibilities! A version of me where I became a professional pianist instead of a theoretical physicist. Or one where I remembered to shower as soon as I came home before getting into bed with you. Or even one where you cheated on me. How dare you!But how did Charlene see it and take those photos, you may ask. A brilliant question, Linda. Truly it shows that we were made for each other and that I would never leave you. Perhaps she saw through a temporary fold in the universe itself and caught a brief glimpse of the mirror version of me. Does that make sense? No? Well, look, the science is unclear. We could discuss hypotheticals for days.Or maybe, more disturbingly, this horrid alternate Professor Montgomery somehow managed to breach the quantum barrier and cross over to our world with his mistress in tow. And in so doing, hacked my cell phone and inserted all those text messages and pictures of my genitals. In fact, I believe I may have been affected directly by such a breach, which explains how I suddenly and inexplicably smelled like women’s perfume last night. Oh dear, Linda. This unsettling possibility bears further investigation. As usual I will be working late while I look into this some more. I will be out at least until 11:30.Do you realize what this all means, Linda? It means that there are infinite versions of me out there. Most of whom certainly would never think of cheating on you. There is even a universe out there where Charlene never saw what she saw on the bus last night and didn’t take any pictures at all.What a truly wonderful universe that would be. Truly wonderful.;FAKE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

28;Members of Congress race back for $2.2tn stimulus vote amid fears of delay;Members of Congress are racing back to Washington, despite social isolation guidelines, out of fear that a lawmaker could delay a Friday vote on the $2.2tn economic stimulus package designed to rush federal aid to workers, businesses and a healthcare system ravaged by the coronavirus.Coronavirus live news: Spain records highest single-day death toll and withdraws 'inaccurate' testing kits Read moreThe desire by House leaders was to pass the bill with a “voice vote” – when everyone in the chamber shouts “aye” or “no” and the loudest group prevails. But any member of Congress can demand a rollcall vote and require a quorum, forcing at least 216 lawmakers to return to Washington in the midst of a pandemic to ensure the bill passes.There is no doubt the law has enough support to pass. The Senate approved the bill in a unanimous vote on Wednesday night. House speaker Nancy Pelosi said she expected broad bipartisan support and Donald Trump has said he would sign it into law.All eyes are on Republican congressman Thomas Massie, a libertarian from Kentucky with little loyalty to party leadership, who has expressed his dismay about moving forward on the legislation without a recorded vote.In a series of tweets on Friday morning, Trump assailed Massie as a “third rate Grandstander” and “a disaster for America, and for the Great State of Kentucky!” He suggested Republicans should “throw Massie out” of the party.“He just wants the publicity. He can’t stop it, only delay, which is both dangerous...& costly,” Trump wrote. “Workers & small businesses need money now in order to survive. Virus wasn’t their fault.”﻿Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Looks like a third rate Grandstander named @RepThomasMassie, a Congressman from, unfortunately, a truly GREAT State, Kentucky, wants to vote against the new Save Our Workers Bill in Congress. He just wants the publicity. He can’t stop it, only delay, which is both dangerous......On Capitol Hill, Massie dismissed concerns about legislators having to fly back to Washington, noting that he chose to drive and suggesting stranded colleagues might “hitch a ride with a trucker”.Massie has left a trail of hints about his intentions – but has not said definitively whether he will object to a voice vote.“They’re trying to convince us it should be a voice vote. It shouldn’t be recorded,” Massie told a radio station on Thursday. “I’m struggling with this.”His colleagues are furious. At least two House members have tested positive for coronavirus, while a number of others are awaiting test results or in quarantine after coming into contact with an infected person.“Dear @RepThomasMassie: If you intend to delay passage of the #coronavirus relief bill tomorrow morning, please advise your 428 colleagues RIGHT NOW so we can book flights and expend ~$200,000 in taxpayer money to counter your principled but terribly misguided stunt,” Minnesota congressman Dean Phillips tweeted on Thursday night.Republican congressman Fred Upton of Michigan said he was “driving back to DC to help get this thing over the finish line” while several lawmakers from western states said they were jumping on red-eye flights to make it back in time.“Getting on a red eye,” California congressman Mike Levin, tweeted. “Too much is at stake and Americans can’t afford to wait any longer.”“I am jumping on the red eye tonight,” Arizona congressman Ruben Gallego, a Democrat, tweeted. “Thanks Massie.”On his flight was another member of the Arizona congressional delegation, Republican congressman Paul Gosar, who Gallego said helped assist a passenger who passed out on the flight. Gosar is a dentist.Ruben Gallego (@RubenGallego) I am now an fully awake on my red eye to DC! But thank you to @repgosar answering the call when the flight attendants asked for anyone with medical background! He answered when a young man passed out suddenly on this flight! #coronavirusThe House will convened at 9am ET. There will be three hours of debate on the legislation before they attempt to pass the bill by voice vote.“Members are advised that it is possible this measure will not pass by voice vote,” House majority leader Steny Hoyer wrote in an advisory to members on Thursday night. “Members are encouraged to follow the guidance of their local and state health officials, however if they are able and willing to be in Washington DC by 10am [Friday]. Members are encouraged to do so with caution.”If a recorded vote is required, the House is planning to enforce strict social distancing guidelines, allowing members on the floor to vote in small groups to avoid crowding.A memo from the sergeant-at-arms, Paul Irving, and the House attending physician, Brian Monahan, not so subtly suggested members of the chamber, where the age range spans from 30 to 86, consider staying home. In bolded and underlined text, they wrote: “Members should use extreme care and deliberation when making the determination to travel to Washington DC.”“We will be monitoring the number of members in the Capitol and on the floor to ensure we maintain safe social distancing at all times,” they added. “Members who are ill with respiratory symptoms or fever are discouraged from attending.”;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
29;New York mayor urges Trump to help as more US coronavirus hotspots emerge;"New York mayor urges Trump to help as more US coronavirus hotspots emergeNew York City has recorded 85 deaths from coronavirus in 24 hours, with the number of patients on ventilators doubling, while hotspots emerge in New Orleans, Chicago, Philadelphia and Detroit and early-hit states such as California and Washington continue to battle the virus.Coronavirus US live: single Republican may stall $2.2tn stimulus package Read moreCases in New York City rose on Thursday to 23,112, up 15% from the 20,011 cases reported a day earlier, according to city authorities, as medical personnel described scenes in some of the city’s hospitals as “very challenging”.Health officials said the number of confirmed cases in the cityprobably represents just a fraction of all those infected. New York’s death toll was 365, up 30% from the 280 deaths reported on Wednesday.“We are holding on,” said Mitch Katz, the head of the NYC Health and Hospitals system. “It is very rough, it is very challenging, but all of the hospitals are working above their capacity to meet the need.”New York City mayor Bill de Blasio said on Friday morning that healthcare workers at many of the city’s hospitals “are going through hell” and once again pleaded with the federal government for more ventilators. De Blasio warned New Yorkers that the situation will deteriorate further before things improve.He told Good Morning America: “There is a lot of fear. I don’t blame healthcare workers for that – they are going through hell.”De Blasio described Donald Trump’s aspiration that the US could “get back to work” by Easter Sunday, April 12, as “false hope” and said the city was prepared to be on a stay-at-home footing for its 8 million residents at least through May.De Blasio continued: “We have to be really honest about where this is going. We have enough supplies to get through this week and next week. After that, we think this crisis is going to grow.”On Thursday evening, Trump downplayed the number of ventilators he thinks New York will need.The president told Sean Hannity on Fox News: “I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they’re going to be.”He continued: “I don’t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators. You go into major hospitals sometimes they’ll have two ventilators and now, all of a sudden, they’re saying, ‘Can we order 30,000 ventilators?’”De Blasio on Friday hit back at Trump’s estimate. He said: “When the president says New York doesn’t need 30,000 ventilators, he is not looking at this astronomical growth, and a ventilator means you live or die. We have in New York City 2,500 ventilators in the last week or so. The state needs 30,000, [of which] the city needs 15,000. This is going to get worse.”De Blasio added: “We need the president. This is the blunt reality. It would be better for the president to be honest with people. We have a tough fight ahead.”Taking new measures to enforce social distancing, New York has taken down dozens of basketball hoops across the city and is planning to close wide boulevards in the Bronx and Brooklyn to traffic to allow pedestrians more space to move around while distancing themselves from each other.We need the president. This is the blunt reality. It would be better for the president to be honest with people Bill de BlasioThe navy hospital ship Mercy is expected in New York as early as Monday. The White House said it may serve as a hospital for non-coronavirus medical cases, allowing the city’s hospitals to focus solely on cases of the contagion.In Chicago, city officials closed its famous lakefront to the public, after too many crowds were gathering on the shores of Lake Michigan. Mayor Lori Lightfoot told Chicagoans in a vociferous public plea: “Dear God: stay home, save lives.”Illinois officials reported 673 new known cases, including seven additional deaths. That brings the known statewide total to 2,538 cases and 26 deaths, Illinois department of public health director Ngozi Ezike said.Michigan confirmed 564 new cases and 17 more deaths. The state has 2,856 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 60 deaths in the 16 days since recording its first case on 10 March.Joneigh Khaldun, the state’s chief medical executive, warned that the peak, which is centered in Detroit, is “probably a few weeks out.”Khaldun said: “It all depends on what everyone does. If we do appropriate social distancing and people listen to the governor’s executive orders, we’ll be able to flatten that curve.”In Louisiana, the number of known coronavirus cases in Louisiana rose to 2,305 on Thursday, an increase of 510 cases in a day, and a total of 83 deaths, according to the Louisiana department of health.Members of Congress race back for $2.2tn stimulus vote amid fears of delay Read moreNearly half of Louisiana’s cases – 997 – came from New Orleans where the city’s poverty rate, lack of healthcare and affordable housing, and of pre-existing medical conditions among city residents, is fueling infection.Research conducted by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette concluded that coronavirus cases here have spread at a faster rate in the first two weeks than any state in America or any country in the world.﻿Amid the statistics, personal stories are beginning to emerge.

30;How US governors are fighting coronavirus – and Donald Trump;Governors have found themselves under an intense spotlight, highlighting an evolving dynamic between those running states and an impossible-to-predict presidentAmerica’s state governors have found themselves under an intense national spotlight in response to the coronavirus pandemic.The additional scrutiny has also highlighted an evolving dynamic between these chief executives who operate the country’s states and a White House run by a mercurial president whose public statements and policy turns are often impossible to predict.'A nightmare all over again': after surviving Katrina, New Orleans battles Covid-19 Read moreAs the virus crisis has grown stronger governors’ daily press conferences and media calls on the coronavirus have become primetime events for a worried and often fearful populace. Governors, the typically aloof top state officials, are currently some of the most reliable sources of information on confirmed coronavirus cases and updates on medical supplies in response to the virus.“The governors are acting in a way governors traditionally act, it just so happens that governors have more of an audience for it now,” said the former Delaware governor Jack Markell, a Democrat.Responses to the pandemic have varied from state to state. Partially because not every governor has the same amount of authority. Some governors can activate the national guard or order schools closed essentially on their own. Others have had to take legislative routes or make other bureaucratic moves.There have been some markings of a deeper ideological divide to responding to the virus. Some Republican governors, such as Arizona’s Doug Ducey, have loudly touted new partnerships with private business to fight the pandemic while some Democrats have leaned more on executive orders to slow the outbreak down.Governors have also received more attention from Donald Trump than they otherwise would.New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, has received both praise and criticism from the president. Cuomo has regularly been in touch with Trump but at times criticized the federal government’s help to his state. Illinois’ governor, JB Pritzker, and Michigan’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, , have gotten into public spats with Trump on Twitter.At the same time, Republican and Democratic governors are learning how to shape their public comments under the intense scrutiny of a TV-obsessed president eager to return praise and respond to criticism with more criticism. It is a tough tightrope to walk and in the face of dealing with a pandemic comes with life-or-death high stakes.California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, usually an eager critic of the president, has repeatedly praised the Trump administration for how it has responded to the crisis. Newsom has praised Trump for the president’s “focus on treatments”.Facebook Twitter Pinterest California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, speaks in Rancho Cordova, California, on 23 March. Photograph: Rich Pedroncelli/APConversely, Pritzker found himself in a Twitter feud with the president where, at one point, the top Illinois Democrat called Trump a carnival barker. Trump has also fumed at Washington’s governor, Jay Inslee, calling him a “snake”.“It’s a two-way street,” Trump said of dealing with governors during a Fox News town hall. “They have to treat us well.”There’s been an increased level of coordination and note trading between governors as well. Usually, each governor is mostly siloed off from even their closest neighbors. But conference calls with the White House or one-on-one calls and joint statements between governors have become more regular.We’ve just started texting and calling each other as we look to [ask] ‘Why did you do this? What was the thought process?' Kansas’ governor, Laura Kelly“There is a lot of chatter amongst governors,” said Kansas’ governor, Laura Kelly, a Democrat, in an interview with the Guardian. “We’ve just started texting and calling each other as we look to [ask] ‘Why did you do this? What was the thought process behind this?’ as we’re trying to make decisions for our own states.”The National Governors Association, the nonpartisan umbrella organization, has helped to facilitate conference calls between the governors and a White House. The Democratic Governors Association and the Republican Governors Association have been sharing information about what governors have been doing on the pandemic with their members.A call between Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, and Georgia’s governor, Brian Kemp, on Covid-19 was listed on DeSantis’s public schedule in mid-March. Whitmer, a Democrat, and Ohio’s Republican governor, Mike DeWine issued a joint statement urging Trump to take extra steps to protect the auto industry from financial ruin during the pandemic and resulting economic collapse.The White House has been interacting with governors regularly. South Dakota’s governor, Kristi Noem, talked extensively with Larry Kudlow, the director of Trump’s National Economic Council, on Wednesday. On Thursday the Trump administration released a letter sent to every governor detailing how it planned to release new guidelines for classifying counties as “high-risk”, “medium-risk” or “low-risk” on the coronavirus. The Trump administration has regularly held conference calls with governors.According to a Republican aide to one of the governors on those calls, oftentimes the calls start out with “Vice-President Mike Pence giving an update on what the latest is that’s going on on a federal level”. Then Dr Deborah Birx, the response coordinator for the Trump administration’s coronavirus taskforce, will give a medical update on the virus. Then governors are free to ask questions. The calls have been cordial and fairly non combative. There was another one on Thursday and one planned for next week.“It really, probably more than anything, continues to be a discussion about supply chains and quantities,” Kelly said. “I think every governor is experiencing a problem with that. A problem with getting tests done and getting test results back.”As governors have enjoyed additional national and local attention, New York’s Cuomo has received an outsized amount. That’s partially because New York has been one of the most hardest hit locations of the virus. He has seen more press than any other governor, even ones being mentioned as possible presidential candidates in 2024.Are Trump's coronavirus briefings the new 2020 campaign rallies? Read more“Quite honestly, he has done a wonderful job of communicating and keeping people informed,” Kelly said. She pointed out that New York has really been a “hotbed” for the virus and that “it’s such a huge driver of all things American – it’s our financial sector, it’s all sorts of things”.Elsewhere there has been an unusual level of agreement among governors. In the community of governors there’s a growing, bipartisan level of skepticism about that the US could reopen by Easter, as Trump is hoping for. Asked if that’s feasible, Kelly said: “No, and I think it’s very unhelpful to even say those things.”Similarly, during a press conference on Thursday, Noem, when pressed, doubted that her state would be back to normal soon.“I do not think South Dakota will be back to normal for many months – many months,” Noem said.;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

32;Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock in self-isolation with coronavirus;"UK prime minister and health secretary say they have mild symptoms and will continue to lead Covid-19 responseBoris Johnson and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, have tested positive for coronavirus, they revealed on Friday, leaving them to work in isolation on leading the government’s efforts to tackle the pandemic.The prime minister, who is 55, will self-isolate for seven days in his flat above No 11 Downing Street after announcing that he had mild symptoms of a cough and temperature.Johnson received the result at midnight, just hours after he was seen outside the door of No 10 clapping in support of NHS workers alongside the chancellor, Rishi Sunak.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Boris Johnson (R) and Rishi Sunak clap in appreciation of NHS workers. Photograph: Andrew Parsons/10 Downing Street/AFP via Getty ImagesHancock, who has responsibility for the NHS, said he would self-isolate until next Thursday.Both men have been in repeated contact with senior political figures, including cabinet members, and advisers in the last few days. But despite the two men testing positive, no other ministers, nor the chief medical officer or chief scientific officer would be tested for the virus unless they showed symptoms, Downing Street said.It is unknown how Johnson contracted the illness but officials confirmed other people who worked in No 10 were self-isolating after having coronavirus symptoms.Johnson posted a video on Friday morning on Twitter saying he had a temperature and a persistent cough. “I am working from home, I’m self-isolating, and that’s entirely the right thing to do,” he said.In the video, which Johnson recorded himself on a mobile phone, he said: “Be in no doubt that I can continue thanks to the wizardry of modern technology to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus.”Boris Johnson #StayHomeSaveLives (@BorisJohnson) Over the last 24 hours I have developed mild symptoms and tested positive for coronavirus.I am now self-isolating, but I will continue to lead the government’s response via video-conference as we fight this virus.Together we will beat this. #StayHomeSaveLives pic.twitter.com/9Te6aFP0RiThe prime minister’s official spokesman said on Friday: “The prime minister’s symptoms are mild and he is continuing to do all of the same functions he was performing before. The only difference is now he will have to do that by teleconferencing.”Johnson chaired this morning’s Covid-19 meeting of government ministers and health experts. His regular audience with the Queen has been conducted by phone for at least two weeks.Although the foreign secretary is officially the person who steps in to cover the prime minister’s role if he is incapacitated, there are no plans for Dominic Raab to stand in for Johnson.The Downing Street spokesperson said: “From the moment he had symptoms he took steps to ensure that he wasn’t in close contact with anyone.“He did really want to take part in clapping NHS staff. It’s something he felt was important but in taking part in that national moment he ensured he didn’t come into close contact with anyone.“He stood outside No 10 at a very significant distance from the chancellor.”On testing people who have been close to Johnson in recent days, he said: “No 10 is considered a workplace. The advice to staff here and the prime minister’s colleagues is they don’t need to do anything in terms of self-isolation unless they start to suspect that they have symptoms, in which case they should follow the Public Health England advice.”No 11 and the four-bedroom flat, which was previously occupied by the former prime ministers David Cameron and Tony Blair, have been sealed off from No 10 Downing Street and No 12 by shutting the doors that staff and government officials use to move between the buildings.The prime minister will work from the office usually used by the chancellor, who has given it over to Johnson during his period of isolation. It has been kitted out with full videoconferencing equipment.Sunak will continue to work from his office in the Treasury; it is not thought that his wife and young children are living at Downing Street. His predecessor, Sajid Javid, lived in the smaller flat at No 10.It is not known whether the chancellor has been tested.Quick guide What to do if you have coronavirus symptoms in the UK Show Hide Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either: a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or backa new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start. Even if it means they're at home for longer than 14 days. If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days. If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible. After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine. If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal. If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.Staying at home means you should: not go to work, school or public areasnot use public transport or taxisnot have visitors, such as friends and family, in your homenot go out to buy food or collect medicine – order them by phone or online, or ask someone else to drop them off at your home You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people. If you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the NHS 111 coronavirus service to find out what to do.

The recommendation for members of the household of someone who has the virus is to self-isolate for 14 days.The World Health Organization has said there is no evidence that pregnant women are at higher risk of severe illness than the general population if they contract Covid-19.Its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, offered his best wishes to Johnson. “Please take good care,” he wrote on Twitter. “I wish you an easy recovery.”The Downing Street spokesman said: “The prime minister follows all of the guidelines which have been issued by Public Health England in full.

33;'Stranded at sea': cruise ships around the world are adrift as ports turn them away;"A Guardian analysis finds that at least ten ships – carrying nearly 10,000 passengers – remain at sea after their destinations refuse them'Stranded at sea': cruise ships around the world are adrift as ports turn them away'Stranded at sea': cruise ships around the world are adrift as ports turn them awayPorts around the globe are turning cruise ships away en mass amid the corona pandemic, leaving thousands of passengers stranded even as some make desperate pleas for help while sickness spreads aboard.A Guardian analysis of ship tracking data has found that, as of Thursday, at least ten ships around the world – carrying nearly 10,000 passengers – are still stuck at sea after having been turned away from their destination ports in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic. Some of the ships are facing increasingly desperate medical situations, including one carrying hundreds of American, Canadian, Australian and British passengers, currently off the coast of Ecuador and seeking permission to dock in Florida.The Holland America ship Zaandam, which has been stranded for days after Chile refused to allow the ship to dock in its original designation of San Antonio on 21 March, reportedly has 140 cases of respiratory illness on board, with some passengers needing breathing support.Police to monitor cruise ship Magnifica as it refuels in WA to ensure no one disembarks Read moreThe ship is steaming up the coast of South America, hoping to make it through the Panama Canal and dock in Florida. But the Florida port, where many of the passengers had planned to disembark on the final leg of the cruise, has refused to confirm that the ship can land.While the Zaandam and at least two other ships still carrying passengers at sea have reported outbreaks of coronavirus-like respiratory illness onboard, other ships are being turned away from docking and unloading their passengers even with no signs of illness at all.‘We need help’Dramatic scenes of coronavirus-stricken cruises, such as the Grand Princess in California and the Diamond Princess in Japan, have become synonymous with the pandemic. The plight of those still adrift highlights how cruise ships have become a kind of pariah of the seas, as cities push back against becoming the next home for a potentially infected vessel.On the Zaandam, which was headed northeast along the coast of Ecuador on Thursday, anxiety was growing.Passengers who spoke with the Guardian describe being locked down in the cabins, with three daily meals left on the floor outside their doors. Meanwhile the number of people reporting influenza-like symptoms has almost tripled this week: 56 passengers and 89 crew members, passengers say the ship’s captain has told them. Four elderly passengers reportedly required oxygen.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Cruise ships sit off shore near the Port of Miami in Florida.

We need help getting a plan together to dock and return to our lives.”Facebook Twitter Pinterest Laura and her husband, Juan Huergo. Passengers were allowed 30 minutes to walk on Wednesday, the first time the couple had left their cabin in three days. Photograph: Courtesy of Laura GabaroniHolland America said this week it had dispatched support in the form of another cruise ship carrying 611 extra staff, supplies and coronavirus test kits to meet up with the Zaandam, and that the cruise line is looking for other alternative locations to disembark passengers.“As all ports along Zaandam’s route are closed to cruise ships, Holland America Line has deployed Rotterdam [the support vessel] to rendezvous with Zaandam and provide extra supplies, staff, Covid-19 test kits and other support as needed,” the company announced on Tuesday.As of Thursday, the Guardian had identified five ships in the Americas that were unable to unload nearly 6,000 passengers. At least three other ships were having trouble off the coast of Australia, including one which sought urgent medical attention for an outbreak of respiratory illness. Two more ships were trying to get passengers to ports in Italy.Lori Bessler, a southern California resident whose parents are stuck aboard the Coral Princess, another boat stranded off the coast of Brazil with no reported illness onboard, says she is nonetheless concerned for her family’s health and wellbeing. “My mom and stepdad are diabetics and ... we’re very concerned about them having enough medication to sustain them,” she told the Guardian.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Crew members aboard a luxury cruise ship docked in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, wear protective masks and gloves. Photograph: Wagner Meier/Getty ImagesThe Coral Princess was due to dock in Buenos Aires on 18 March but is now headed for Florida. So far the cruise ship has only been allowed to disembark passengers from South America; more than a thousand US, Canadian and British citizens, including Bressler’s parents, remain on the ship.Bessler said she has struggled to get information from either the cruise company or from US government officials. She worries that Florida may become overrun by Covid-19 cases by the time the ship arrives there in two weeks.“It’s a scary situation,” said Bessler, who has been texting with her mom many times a day. “I think they need to be rescued and brought to their homes.”‘There is a level of greed’The fast-moving nature of the virus has added to the confusion – when many passengers left for vacations in early March there were no cases of Covid-19 in South America, so they thought it would be safe to travel.But Ross Klein, a professor at St John’s College in Newfoundland who has written four books on the cruise industry, said companies should have acted weeks earlier to cancel trips and refund customers. He noted that cases of cruise ships being turned away from ports as a result of coronavirus fears began as early as January and escalated in February, with passengers being quarantined on the Emerald Princess in Japan on 3 February.“There is a level of greed on the part of these companies,” he said. “They want to make every penny – and they make money when people are on the ships.”Cruise ships are drawing increasing government scrutiny for not doing enough to protect their passengers during this pandemic. In Florida, the attorney general’s office is investigating potentially misleading sales practices, after the Miami New Times obtained leaked emails showing representatives for Norwegian Cruise Lines may have downplayed the coronavirus in sales pitches to passengers, even as the pandemic was disrupting trips. “The Coronavirus can only survive in cold temperatures, so the Caribbean is a fantastic choice for your next cruise,” said one sales script obtained by the paper.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Passengers sit in quarantine aboard a cruise ship in Fremantle, Australia. Photograph: Paul Kane/Getty ImagesDespite Donald Trump’s repeated vows to bail out the cruise ship industry, money for cruise companies was not a part of the $500bn in aid for large employers included in stimulus bill passed by Congress on Wednesday.Most of the major cruise operators register their companies in countries such as Panama and Liberia, thereby avoiding most US taxes and labor laws. Thus, the cruise industry’s trade group said Thursday the companies will not have access to the US aid for large employers, according to the Washington Post.Meanwhile a report from the US Centers for Disease Control this week laid the blame on cruise ships for spreading the virus in the crucial early weeks of the outbreak, linking hundreds of cases to the Diamond Princess and Grand Princess.“Cruise ships are often settings for outbreaks of infectious diseases because of their closed environment, contact between travelers from many countries, and crew transfers between ships,” the CDC report concluded.Back aboard the Zaandam, passengers are passing the time however they can. Some chat with other cabins on a Facebook group, others enjoy the free liquor, snap pictures of brown boobies flying outside their windows, or partake in meditation, yoga classes and a daily quiz offered via the ship’s TV. Passengers joke the top quiz prize should be extra face masks or toilet paper, or a chance to get outside and do laps around the promenade deck.Jamsheed Master, one of the ship’s piano players, wrote on Facebook that he has composed a thousand songs during his confinement.But despite moments of levity, the situation is bleak.“I’m safe and healthy right now. Staying confined in my cabin except for the strange ritual of eating meals in the crew mess while maintaining a safe distance from each other,” he wrote Monday. “I won’t lie: things are looking grim here and I just want to go home. We all do.”";REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
34;Did a New York Times article inspire Trump's 'back to work' plan?;A New York Times piece by a diet specialist appears to have informed Trump’s idea to open up the country by EasterAt the start of this week, as millions were following US government advice to combat the coronavirus pandemic by physical distancing and staying indoors, Donald Trump abruptly declared that people needed to soon return to work.Coronavirus US live: Pelosi says stimulus will pass but Congress is 'not doing enough' Read more“At a certain point we have to get open and we have to get moving. We don’t want to lose these companies. We don’t want to lose these workers,” Trump said at a White House press conference. Trump said this was going to happen “very soon”.The policy of returning to normal, nearly all epidemiologists warn, carries a threat of catastrophe: of allowing the virus to spread just as the measures proven to curb it are starting to work.So where did Trump’s U-turn come from?As frequently is the case with Trump’s political ideas, he seems to have been inspired – at least in part – by Fox News, and also by thinkpieces popular among conservatives, but often not written by epidemiologists.On Sunday, the Fox News host Steve Hilton railed against the idea of long-term social distancing. Hilton claimed “working Americans” will be “crushed” by an indefinite work shutdown. Hilton mused that there could be a situation where “the cure is worse than the disease”.Within hours, the Fox News message found its intended target. On Sunday evening Trump tweeted, mangling Hilton’s words slightly: “WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF.”The idea of sending people back to work and restarting the economy had been floating around last weekend, propagated by two opinion pieces in particular. One was written on Medium. Another, published two days before the Hilton show, was an opinion piece by David Katz, a former director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center, which was published by the New York Times. Given the reach of the New York Times this piece, headlined Is Our Fight Against Coronavirus Worse Than the Disease?, attracted huge attention.In the piece, Katz argues that those over 60 and those who are immunologically compromised should be “preferentially protect[ed]”, with focused testing.“This focus on a much smaller portion of the population would allow most of society to return to life as usual and perhaps prevent vast segments of the economy from collapsing,” Katz wrote, adding that then children could return to school and adults return to their jobs.In time, people would develop immunity to the coronavirus, and in the meantime, damage to the economy would be minimized, Katz opined.But as many pointed out, Katz is not an epidemiologist. Instead, he specializes in nutrition advice, and has published a number of dietary books, including The Way to Eat, Cut Your Cholesterol and Stealth Health.Katz’s piece was shared widely among conservatives, including by Fox News host and informal Trump adviser Pete Hegseth. The article served as a handy tool for conservatives advancing the argument that the economy shouldn’t be sacrificed for coronavirus containment.A group of Yale epidemiologists swiftly wrote a letter to the Times, rebutting Katz’s piece. Others pointed out Katz’s lack of credentials and his links to big industry. He was once paid $3,500 an hour as an expert witness in a Chobani legal case to defend the sugar contained in its yoghurts.Katz has received hundreds of thousands of dollars from companies including Hershey’s, Kind Bars, the walnut industry and Quaker Oats. The science journalist Nina Teicholz has written about how in some cases, Katz wrote positive articles about those companies after receiving grants.“Dr Katz’s efforts on behalf of public health during this pandemic are uncompensated and born from a sense of duty and commitment to public health,” a spokeswoman for Katz told the Guardian. She pointed to a post Katz wrote on LinkedIn following the criticism, where he stresses how damage to the economy is also a massive public health issue.Yale itself went to lengths to distance itself from Katz. “David Katz is not academically affiliated with Yale and has not held an academic appointment here since 2016,” the university posted on Twitter.Gregg Gonsalves, an assistant epidemiology at the Yale school of public health, said: “Yes, the elderly are at risk. But the ability to sequester safely for months on end, in the United States is untenable. We don’t have a social safety net that maybe continental European countries have.”He said: “The other thing is, low risk doesn’t mean no risk. We don’t know the natural history of the disease well enough to say: ‘Everybody under 65 is A-OK and ready to go back to work.’”Katz’s piece wasn’t the sole inspiration for Trump’s change of mind. The influential Fox News host Laura Ingraham and others eagerly shared a Medium article written by a tech worker named Aaron Ginn over the weekend, which advances some of the same ideas as Katz.Medium later took the article down after widespread criticism, including from experts in infectious diseases.The concept of trading off self-isolation for returning to normal to help the economy has also been pushed by Trump’s cabinet including, his economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who on Tuesday told reporters: “Public health includes economic health.”The arguments advanced by Katz and others, however, are a piece of a movement which could lead to Trump flip-flopping again on the seriousness of the coronavirus – which could be problematic for all.;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

36;Can a face mask protect me from coronavirus? Covid-19 myths busted;The truth about how you can catch coronavirus, who is most vulnerable and what you can do to avoid infectionClaim: ‘Face masks don’t work’Wearing a face mask is certainly not an iron-clad guarantee that you won’t get sick – viruses can also transmit through the eyes and tiny viral particles, known as aerosols, can penetrate masks. However, masks are effective at capturing droplets, which is a main transmission route of coronavirus, and some studies have estimated a roughly fivefold protection versus no barrier alone (although others have found lower levels of effectiveness).If you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on. If you’re showing symptoms of coronavirus, or have been diagnosed, wearing a mask can also protect others. So masks are crucial for health and social care workers looking after patients and are also recommended for family members who need to care for someone who is ill – ideally both the patient and carer should have a mask.However, masks will probably make little difference if you’re just walking around town or taking a bus so there is no need to bulk-buy a huge supply.Claim: ‘It is mutating into a more deadly strain’All viruses accumulate mutations over time and the virus that causes Covid-19 is no different. How widespread different strains of a virus become depends on natural selection – the versions that can propagate quickest and replicate effectively in the body will be the most “successful”. This doesn’t necessarily mean most dangerous for people though, as viruses that kill people rapidly or make them so sick that they are incapacitated may be less likely to be transmitted.Genetic analysis by Chinese scientists of 103 samples of the virus, taken from patients in Wuhan and other cities, suggests that early on two main strains emerged, designated L and S. Although the L strain appeared to be more prevalent than the S strain (about 70% of the samples belonged to the former), the S branch of the virus was found to be the ancestral version.The team behind this research suggested that this may indicate the L strain is more “aggressive”, either transmitting more easily or replicating faster inside the body. However, this theory is speculative at this stage – there haven’t yet been direct comparisons to see whether people who catch one version of the virus are more likely to pass it on or suffer more severe symptoms.Claim: ‘It is no more dangerous than winter flu’Many individuals who get coronavirus will experience nothing worse than seasonal flu symptoms, but the overall profile of the disease, including its mortality rate, looks more serious. At the start of an outbreak the apparent mortality rate can be an overestimate if a lot of mild cases are being missed. But Bruce Aylward, a WHO expert, who led an international mission to China to learn about the virus and the country’s response, said this has not been the case with Covid-19. The evidence did not suggest that we were only seeing the tip of the iceberg. If borne out by further testing, this could mean that current estimates of a roughly 1% fatality rate are accurate. This would make Covid-19 about 10 times more deadly than seasonal flu, which is estimated to kill between 290,000 and 650,000 people a year globally.Claim: ‘It only kills the elderly, so younger people can relax’Most people who are not elderly and do not have underlying health conditions will not become critically ill from Covid-19. But the illness still has a higher chance of leading to serious respiratory symptoms than seasonal flu and there are other at-risk groups – health workers, for instance, are more vulnerable because they are likely to have higher exposure to the virus. The actions that young, healthy people take, including reporting symptoms and following quarantine instructions, will have an important role in protecting the most vulnerable in society and in shaping the overall trajectory of the outbreak.Claim: ‘You need to be with an infected person for 10 minutes’For flu, some hospital guidelines define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person who sneezes or coughs for 10 minutes or longer. However, it is possible to be infected with shorter interactions or even by picking the virus up from contaminated surfaces, although this is thought to be a less common route of transmission.Claim: ‘A vaccine could be ready within a few months’Scientists were quick out of the gates in beginning development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus, helped by the early release of the genetic sequence by Chinese researchers. The development of a viable vaccine continues apace, with several teams now testing candidates in animal experiments. However, the incremental trials required before a commercial vaccine could be rolled out are still a lengthy undertaking – and an essential one to ensure that even rare side-effects are spotted. A commercially available vaccine within a year would be quick.’;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

38;US coronavirus stimulus checks: are you eligible and how much will you get?;Most taxpayers will get a check from the $2tn economic package, the largest in US historyUS coronavirus stimulus checks: are you eligible and how much will you get?The US has agreed on a $2tn stimulus package, the largest economic stimulus in US history, in response to the economic impacts of Covid-19. While corporations will be the biggest recipients of the bailout, some of that money will be paid directly to Americans hit by the pandemic.Most taxpayers will get a check in the mail, while those directly impacted by the economic effects of Covid-19 are slated to receive robust government support.Here’s what we know so far about how the new stimulus package will directly affect Americans in the coming weeks:Who’s eligible for a check from the government?Congress will spend about $250bn for checks up to $1,200 per person that will go directly to taxpayers.To be eligible for the full amount, a person’s most recently filed tax return must show that they made $75,000 or under. For couples, who can receive a maximum of $2,400, the cutoff is $150,000.If a person makes more than $75,000, the amount given goes down incrementally by $5 for every $100 increase in salary. So a person who makes $85,000 would get $700 while a person who makes $95,000 would get $200.If a person makes above $99,000, or a couple makes above $198,000, no check will be given.The Tax Foundation, a DC-based thinktank, estimates that 93.6% of Americans will be eligible for a check coming from the stimulus package.What about parents?Taxpayers will be given $500 per child listed as a dependent on their latest tax return.When will I get this money?That is still unclear. Experts say that Americans will likely not get the money until May, given how long it takes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to send out checks. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said the White House wants the checks out in two weeks but the logistics of sending them will likely make the wait a bit longer.This is not the first time the government has sent checks to Americans. The federal government gave up to $300 in 2001 and $600 in 2008 to taxpayers who met a certain income bracket to similarly stimulate the economy.Does the package help unemployed workers?Yes, specifically the bill will increase unemployment insurance by $600 for 13 weeks – about four months – for every person, added to the existing unemployment compensation a person gets from their state’s program.The length and amount of compensation varies from state to state. A majority of states providing a maximum of 26 weeks of compensation, while average weekly compensation ranges from 20% of a person’s wage to just over 50%.What about freelance and gig workers?While unemployment insurance typically does not cover people who are self-employed – freelancers, contractors and gig workers – the bill comes with a “pandemic unemployment assistance” measure that will extend insurance to those workers.Play Video 2:25 'The universe is collapsing': Bernie Sanders mocks Republicans over coronavirus aid – videoHas there been any changes to paid leave?Not in this bill. Earlier last week, Donald Trump signed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, a bill worth about $100bn meant to expand paid sick leave and emergency paid leave, but it came with major loopholes. Companies with over 500 employees were not mentioned in the bill, while companies with under 50 employees can apply for exemptions.The bill mandates 10 days of fully paid sick leave for employees of companies with 500 employees or less. Parents of those companies affected by their children’s school closing and those leaving for medical reasons can get 12 weeks of pay at 67% of their salary.Will there be anything to offset healthcare costs related to Covid-19?Again, not in this bill. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act included a measure that mandated all Covid-19 testing is free, but treatment for any symptoms (there is currently no cure for the illness) still comes at a cost. A few states have reopened enrollment for their health insurance programs to allow those concerned about costs to enroll, but there are still stories of people getting bills for as much as $34,000 to cover treatment of the virus’ symptoms.;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Find out which countries are experiencing the steepest growth in cases and where the virus has been most deadly.Since first being recorded late last year in China, the Covid-19 coronavirus has spread around the world, and been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. By early spring, Europe had become the worst-affected region, with Italy and Spain particularly hard hit. However, differences in testing mean that the number of cases may be understated for some countries.The number of deaths is sadly a more dependable indicator. Looked at by this measure we again see that the disease is hitting Italy and Spain with particular cruelty. But the trajectory in many countries is the same; the UK and US are a couple of weeks behind Italy in the progress of the epidemic.Meanwhile in Asia, where the disease began, the spread continues, although in China it seems for now to have passed its peak.In Europe most countries have closed schools, and many are in lockdown.Finally, a reminder that most people who contract the disease recover; many may never notice they had it at all.";REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
40;US surpasses China for highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the world;During a press briefing today, Donald Trump said the dates for reopening sections of the country were under discussionDonald Trump again struggled to reassure a fearful nation on Thursday as it emerged the US now has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the world.News that America had surpassed virus hotspots China and Italy with 82,404 cases of infection, according to a tracker run by Johns Hopkins University, broke as the president was holding a press conference at the White House.'$1,200 isn't enough': what a $2tn relief bill means for American workers Read moreHis instinctive response was to question other countries’ statistics. “It’s a tribute to the amount of testing that we’re doing,” Trump told reporters. “We’re doing tremendous testing, and I’m sure you’re not able to tell what China is testing or not testing. I think that’s a little hard.”Trump later spoke to the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, by telephone and had what he described on Twitter as a “very good conversation”. The two leaders discussed the coronavirus in “great detail”, adding that: “China has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect!”Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Just finished a very good conversation with President Xi of China. Discussed in great detail the CoronaVirus that is ravaging large parts of our Planet. China has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect!While the US has increased its testing capacity in recents days the process has been flawed and incoherent, and the country still lags behind leaders such as South Korea in terms of the number of tests administered per-capita.On a grim day, the death toll in America surpassed 1,000 and it was revealed that last week 3.3 million people filed for unemployment – the biggest single-week jump in history. The president has been widely condemned for failing to act fast enough, misjudging the public mood and seeking to blame others rather than taking personal responsibility.“It’s nobody’s fault,” Trump said of the jobless figure. “Certainly not in this country. Nobody’s fault. We got very lucky when we made a decision not to allow people in from China on a very early date. I say that because some people don’t want to accept it, but this was a great decision made by our country, or the numbers that you’re talking about – we’re a big country – they’d be far greater, far bigger.”He added: “I heard it could be six million, could be seven million. It’s 3.3 or 3.2, but it’s a lot of jobs, but I think we’ll come back very strong. The sooner we get back to work – you know, every day we stay out it gets harder to bring it back very quickly, and our people don’t want to stay out ... I think you’ll see a very fast turnaround once we have a victory over the hidden enemy.”Trump told the briefing that dates for reopening sections of the country were under discussion but he notably did not refer to Easter – 12 April – as he has been pushing in recent days.Critics have long accused him of lacking compassion, pointing to examples such as when, in 2017, he lobbed paper towels at hurricane survivors in Puerto Rico. On Thursday he was asked about the thousands of restaurants going out of business, causing personal devastation to owners and staff.“I understand the restaurant business,” he claimed, describing it as “very delicate”. He went on: “You can serve 30 great meals to a person and a family ... one bad meal, 31, and they never come back again. It’s a very tough business.”He added: “It may not be the same restaurant, it may not be the same ownership, but they’ll all be back.”Even as New York hospitals become overwhelmed, with doctors complaining of nightmarish conditions, and cases spike in cities such as New Orleans, Trump continued to talk down the threat from the virus. “Many people have it. I just spoke to two people that had it. They never went to a doctor, they didn’t report it ... The people that actually die, that percentage is much lower than I actually thought.”Coronavirus map of the US: latest cases state by state Read moreHe added, “The mortality rate, in my opinion, is way down,” even though experts have warned that this is likely to worsen in the coming weeks.In a tone that again seemed at odds with the gravity of the situation, Trump asked a reporter from Bloomberg News, “How’s Michael doing, good?” – a reference to the failed presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg – and dismissed a state governor who took part in a conference call as a “wise guy”.He also said he will speak by phone with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping later on Thursday, claiming they have a “very good relationship”. The president has repeatedly used the phrase “Chinese virus”, angering some in that country.“No, it came from China,” he said, but he added, “if they feel so strongly about it, we’ll see.”Vice-president Mike Pence and Deborah Birx, response coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force, also sought to calm fears about a shortage of ventilators, despite media reports to the contrary.Birx said of New York: “To wake up this morning and look at people talking about creating DNR situations, Do-Not-Resuscitate situations for patients – there is no situation in the United States right now that warrants that kind of discussion.”There was some silver lining for Trump on Thursday as stocks rallied on Wall Street for that day after a historic $2tn economic rescue package won passage in the Senate. The plan, which is expected to be voted on in the House of Representatives on Friday, would distribute $1,200 per adult and $500 per child.Joe Biden, the front runner in the Democratic presidential race, said: “The president is not responsible for the coronavirus, but he bears full responsibility for the slow and uncoordinated response that has exacerbated both the public health and economic impact on our country. The harsh reality is that at least 3 million people now don’t have jobs because our president didn’t do his job when it mattered.”;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;'It's like a remote sleepover': my week meeting quarantined strangers;"Just before everything changed, one week ago, I was out in the backyard with my kids. I remember that the moon rose early and bright, and when I pointed to it, my five-year-old said confidently: “That’s not the moon. It’s a quarter floating in the sky.” It took me by surprise, the poetry of his words, and so we giggled and tried to pluck it from the branches of a tree.The next morning, we woke to a world transformed.•••Last Thursday was the first day I kept the kids home from school, though schools in Arizona were technically still open. It seemed the prudent thing to do. Italy was officially in crisis, having logged hundreds of Covid-19 deaths in a single day. We began to hear the phrase “social distancing”. While my first thought was protecting my parents and grandmother, who are at risk because of their ages, my second thought was about art and connection. I wondered immediately, what will we make – separately, together – in this strange, horrifying time?Isolation portraits: the faces of quarantine Read moreI found Quarantine Chat soon after – an app that pairs you by phone with a stranger from somewhere in the world, also in some degree of isolation. Sign up and Quarantine Chat (via the app Dialup) will phone you randomly, approximately once per day. Or sign up for themed calls at scheduled times – read Tarot cards with a stranger on Thursdays; read poetry together on Tuesdays; compare weekend projects on Saturdays; chat about farming on Sundays.Created by the artists Danielle Baskin and Matt Hawkins, Quaratine Chat is a “response to the coronavirus causing people in cities to be in quarantine, isolating humans from each other”. Though Baskin and Hawkins began Dialup a year ago as a way to connect communities in random one-on-one calls, Quarantine Chat officially launched on 1 March.“We thought it was for cheering up people in self-isolation or in quarantine, but it became more relevant as cities started mandating lockdown,” said Baskin. “We’ve been hearing so many stories from people using it … Someone in Connecticut spoke to someone in London and exchanged recipes. Someone in Pakistan matched with someone in Oman while he was out grocery shopping.”To explain why this was instantly compelling to me, I’ll say this: I was a teenager in the 1990s, during the nascent era of AOL chat rooms, when corresponding with anonymous strangers was a common after-school activity. I liked the phone, too, and I spent so many hours talking to friends and crushes – “What are you thinking about?” … “I dunno, what are you thinking about?” – that the shape of the phone would become imprinted on my face. Quarantine Chat seemed a nostalgic echo of that time, providing a one-on-one human connection during a time of chaos.My first call came Saturday afternoon. I picked up the phone to some jazzy elevator music and a recorded message inviting me to talk to a stranger about my weekend projects. And suddenly I was talking to Antony in Moscow. It was almost midnight there, cold and dark, he said, with just a bit of snow on the ground. I told him about the blue Arizona sky, the smell of orange blossoms wafting through the open windows, the midday sun. We talked to one another as we worked on our projects. Mine involved disinfecting doorknobs. He was building an app. I told him I’d just begun to get concerned about coronavirus. He said he was staying away from his parents because of their age, but that he wasn’t too worried yet. We talked about art – my writing and his watercolor paintings of mountains and oceans, places he has never been. After 45 minutes, my children began demanding snacks. Before we hung up, Antony told me: “I think, just don’t panic. But if you can write about this time, you should.”The day unrolled like thread. I scrubbed and did laundry and watched the news, which seemed to be constantly breaking. I began to doubt the possibility of additional grocery store runs and took everything out of my pantry to assess my supply. I set a trap for the mouse who had eaten through part of my toilet paper stash overnight.I had just turned off the lights in the house when my phone rang. “Have I got a story for you,” said the woman on the phone, who turned out to be E from California. Weeks ago, E was exposed to Covid-19 at work and became symptomatic. When she went to the hospital for a test, she was escorted into an isolated exam room by nurses in hazmat suits. She could not leave the room even to use the bathroom, so they brought her a toilet seat with a bucket attached. They swabbed her, took chest X-rays, and sent her home to quarantine. After a week and a half in home quarantine, she was still waiting for her test results.The gift of this time is to really think about what is important, and who is importantAt home, she grew sicker, and there was a moment when she wondered if she would die. “I thought, is this it?” she told me. “And then I thought, what the hell am I doing with my life?”In that moment, it was so clear. She didn’t want to spend her life working in an office. She wanted to be outside. She wanted to ride her dirt bike every day. Maybe, she said, when this is all over, she’ll go back to her rural acreage on the east coast, back to her kind neighbors and her rescue horse. We wondered out loud to each other: how many times have we made decisions to follow a lover or a job? What would we choose instead if we listened to the deepest part of ourselves?“The gift of this time is to really think about what is important, and who is important,” she said. We talked until we were both falling asleep – “It’s like a remote sleepover,” she laughed – and then we said goodnight.•••I woke up to a slew of breaking news alerts on my phone, new death tolls, a stock market freefall, the emergence of the hashtag #QuarantineLife. I also woke up sick – runny nose, sore throat, earache, but not the telltale Covid-19 fever or cough. The world suddenly seemed particularly small. I began thinking of each part of my house as its own tiny country, the hallway with its terrible carpet running like a border between east and west. Panic began: What if long-term quarantine lasts through summer? How will anyone be able to afford rent or food or supplies? What if this is the beginning of a new society? What if we can’t actually go vote?To distract from impending doom, I sat with my kids at the kitchen table and we made a list of activities: Mario Kart tournament. Virtual Trivial Pursuit with my brother and sister-in-law 2,000 miles away. Write a letter. Read a book. Take a walk. Try to break the world record of trampoline bounces. Put on a play over FaceTime. Learn to play the guitar. Bake something.The thing that feels the strangest is that we are sitting ducks. That this thing is moving toward us, that all we can do is hole up and waitAt 1.30, I picked up a call from Quarantine Chat. The prompt asked us to think of something that used to scare us but doesn’t any more, and to discuss it with our phone partner. If I’m being honest, I said to a Postmates driver in Chicago, most of the things that used to scare me still do. We talked about what it’s like to stay inside day after day, about being worried about our parents, about incarcerated folks who don’t even have soap or hand sanitizer. “The thing that feels the strangest is that we are sitting ducks,” I said. “That this thing is moving toward us, that all we can do is hole up and wait.”Another call came a few hours later: a high school sophomore with a voice like a bird. From her window, she said she could see some cars and the tips of winter trees. Now that school was canceled, she wasn’t sure what the next few weeks would look like. Maybe she’d return to the novel she had been writing. The day before, she took what might be her last outdoor adventure with a friend. They had gone to an abandoned house – explored the foundation, picked slowly through all the old junk. She wasn’t sure how long she’d be able to go outside. Most of her friends weren’t allowed to go outside at all any more.•••On Tuesday, my cousin brought her kids to the lawn outside our grandpa’s new apartment to wave and blow him kisses. She sent a picture of the kids, pyjama-clad, holding a homemade sign that read “We [heart] U Grandpa!” Behind them in the photo, a tree was beginning to flower. Through a second-story window, I could just barely make out the lines of my grandpa’s striped shirt.Coronavirus heroes: the doctors carrying an immense burden to care for us Read moreWednesday, I was signed up for the poetry call, but it never came. The app has had so much traffic – going from 60 users to more than 800 in two weeks – that the artists reported working overtime to support new users and reply to app-related issues. Instead, I reached out to Lisa, a real-life friend who was also waiting for the poetry call, and we read poems to each other over the phone. I chose one by Minnie Bruce Pratt: I am alone in a solitude that vibrates like the cicada in hot midmorning.And Lisa read a Joy Harjo poem: Let the earth stabilize your postcolonial insecure jitters.Be respectful of the small insects, birds and animal people who accompany you.Ask their forgiveness for the harm we humans have brought down upon them.Outside, the sun went down, and the desert sky faded from pink to pale purple. I sat in the driveway and watched the last few crane flies bob through the air. Soon, they will be gone, and the cacti will flower, and the world will keep turning. And I will keep picking up the phone.";REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
42;'A nightmare all over again': after surviving Katrina, New Orleans battles Covid-19;"Ronald Lewis’s home was among the first to be rebuilt after Hurricane Katrina swept away much of New Orleans’s Lower Ninth ward. In the 15 years after, as this city’s poorest neighbourhood struggled to recover, Lewis became its most impassioned advocate and cultural champion – founder of the House of Dance & Feathers, a community museum dedicated to African American city street culture.But last week Lewis, the 68-year-old neighbourhood hero, became one of the first to die in New Orleans after contracting the novel coronavirus, which has swept through this city and throughout the state of Louisiana at a rate in keeping with the worst in the world.“I need to rest my mind, and my body. They are both aching,” said Lewis’s grieving wife, Charlotte, in a brief phone interview.“He was one of the best,” said his neighbour Jimmy Lewis. “After Katrina he spoke up for us all. He was full of love and concern.”jimmy and ninth ward Left: Jimmy Lewis has mostly stayed inside or on his front porch in the Lower Ninth ward of New Orleans. Right: Homes in the Lower Ninth ward. Lower income people in New Orleans will be especially affected by the outbreak. Photographs by Bryan Tarnowski/The GuardianAs the afternoon sun began to dip over the Ninth ward’s silent streets, Lewis, another survivor of the hurricane that remains inked in people’s memory here, began thinking about the current crisis – its similarities and its many differences.“We were flooded before, but this time it’s dry. They’re both flowing. One by water, the other by air,” he said. “It will test our hearts and our minds like last time, but we will overcome again.”As the coronavirus pandemic takes hold across America, major outbreaks in the coastal cities of Seattle and New York City have dominated headlines. But New Orleans, the historic city on Louisiana’s southern tip, has more quietly become one of the worst-affected areas in America.As of Wednesday there were 1,975 confirmed Covid-19 cases in Louisiana, with more than 800 in New Orleans alone. Sixty-five people have been killed by the virus in the state, with over half those in New Orleans. The death toll is only six less than in California, a state with 35 million more people.Analysis by local news outlet the Advocate earlier in the week highlighted that New Orleans has a higher per-capita rate of infection than some boroughs of New York City. Research conducted by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette concluded that coronavirus cases here have spread at a faster rate in the first two weeks than any state in America or any country in the world.“If you’re looking at what we’ve seen around the world, if you think that the situation in Spain and Italy is dire, well, we’re on that trajectory too,” said Dr Gary Wagner, who authored the research.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Haji Ahkba played trumpet on the corner of Royal Street and St Peter Street in the French Quarter, a popular corner for musicians that usually draws dozens of spectators.

Photograph: Bryan Tarnowski/Bryan Tarnowski for The GuardianOn Tuesday, the Trump administration, reeling from criticism of its botched national response to the crisis, which critics have label
led Trump’s “viral Katrina” – a reference to George W Bush’s disastrous handling of the response to the 2005 hurricane – issued a major disaster declaration for Louisiana following similar orders in New York, Washington and California. Hours later, the Louisiana governor, John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, forecast that the state would reach hospital capacity by the first week of April as he pleaded for more ventilators.The sobering acknowledgment came as little surprise to Dr David Mushatt, chief of infectious diseases at Tulane University and one of those on the frontlines treating intensive care Covid-19 patients at University medical center in New Orleans.Doctors here, like other locations around the world, have begun discussing the ethics of rationing and prioritizing care as beds come close to filling up.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Dr David Mushatt, an infectious disease doctor and professor at Tulane Medical, quarantined at his home in New Orleans.

Photograph: Bryan Tarnowski/The Guardian“It breaks your heart, because you know that patients probably aren’t getting the same amount of attention that they would have if they didn’t have this infectious, deadly virus,” Mushatt said. “There’s no way that nurses and doctors can spend the amount of time that they would like to in the room because there’s not enough protective gear.”Mushatt, who has been forced to self-isolate after being exposed to the virus by a patient, described the physical and emotional toll of fighting the disease head on.“You’re fighting for the most challenging life of your career, but it’s every single patient,” he said. “And then there is the fear of the unknown. As bad as it is already, is it going to get worse? Will we have enough ventilators? Nurses? Enough room?”Other experts pointed to a number of factors that could explain New Orleans’s status as an early coronavirus hotspot: at the end of February the city celebrated the annual Mardi Gras festival, drawing a million visitors to crammed street parades.“We get a lot of people for those springtime events, and we’re already a very close-knit community,” said Richard Oberhelman, professor of community health at Tulane University. “Anytime you have large groups of people together, then you’re going to have more opportunities for transmission once it’s introduced.”Now, New Orleans’s busiest areas are almost entirely empty. Bourbon Street, in the city’s historic French Quarter, just weeks ago packed with thousands of Mardi Gras revellers, is lined with boarded-up shopfronts and bars, the hum of fluorescent signage often the loudest noise on the block.Edwards ordered a statewide stay-at-home order over the weekend in an attempt to flatten the curve, but Wednesday’s infection rate announcement and death toll marked the steepest increase in figures so far in Louisiana.“The problem isn’t that cases are growing every day, it’s that they’re growing drastically every day,” Edwards said.This deep south state is also one of the poorest in America, with 20% of residents living in poverty. New Orleans’s economy is dependent on tourism, and with restaurants and bars forced to offer takeout-only services, many have begun laying off staff. Earlier in the week the Advocate, the paper that has driven in-depth coverage of the crisis here, announced it had been forced to furlough staff and issue a 20% pay cut. Statewide unemployment claims soared from an average of 1,400 new claims a week to 71,000.Burnell Cotlon Left: Burnell Cotlon in his small market in the Lower Ninth ward of New Orleans.

Many of his loyal customers have no money left to pay for basics, including toilet paper, soap and vegetables. The tally is already $722.13 – a major amount for his business.“Musicians, hotel and restaurant workers, people who used to have 40 hours work a day, now have nothing,” Cotlon, who constructed the store on a plot destroyed by Katrina said. “Some people are coming in here, crying and begging for work.”Cotlon’s mother, who just lost her job, is also in self-isolation after being exposed to the virus.“It’s like a nightmare all over again,” he said. “I remember coming back after Katrina, losing my home, I cried like a baby. To go through this all again … words can’t describe.”";REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;Georgia Covid-19 cases rise as Atlanta mayor warns hospitals are at capacity;Keishia Lance Bottoms has mandated a city-wide shutdown for Atlanta as she predicts a collapse in its healthcare systemThe coronavirus crisis in Georgia is spiraling as the mayor of Atlanta has warned that intensive care unit (ICU) beds in the city have reached capacity even though the level of the virus in the state is likely still far from its peak.With more than 1,200 cases across the southern state, according to Georgia’s Department of Health, the state’s largest hospital, Grady Memorial, has been down at least 200 ICU beds since December due to a flood, a hospital staff member with knowledge of the hospital’s situation tells the Guardian.Metro Atlanta’s nine counties have a total of 1,045 ICU beds, according to a tally of beds compiled by Kaiser Health News.Atlanta, the state’s capital, is the most densely populated region, with nearly half a million residents – more than half of the state’s population. Nearly one out of six cases in state are in the Atlanta metro area. Unlike other US centers of the crisis such as New York, where large convention facilities are being used to place more beds, ventilators and supplies, that has not been the case in Atlanta.US hospitals postpone non-emergency procedures amid coronavirus pandemic Read moreKeishia Lance Bottoms, the mayor of Atlanta, said the situation could see a collapse of the state’s healthcare system sooner, rather than later.“People have to understand that when we overrun our health care – our hospitals – that people will still come in with heart attacks, people will still have car accidents. These things that happen every day on top of Covid-19 will make our healthcare system collapse in the same way that you’re seeing that happen in New York and you’re seeing it happen across the globe,” she said in a local television interview.Grady Hospital did not respond to the Guardian’s query asking about its current limitations.For now, the city’s mayor has mandated a city-wide shutdown – a further step than the state’s Republican governor has suggested.Until Wednesday morning, Georgia also had the fourth highest death toll of coronavirus patients, until Louisiana’s cases skyrocketed. With over half a dozen Georgia hospitals shutting down during the past decade across rural communities, much of the state’s health care has been lacking. In 2017, a study found Georgia had one of the worst health care systems in the country, ranking it 49th for access.Soon after Donald Trump announced his coronavirus task force, so did the state’s governor, whose actions have mimicked what is happening at a federal level.“The [Georgia] Coronavirus Task Force is diligently working to identify and organize additional bed capacity across the state – including in areas seeing community spread of Covid-19. This is a top priority for our staff and we’ll continue to work around the clock to make sure those resources are available to hospitals in need,” the governor’s spokesperson told the Guardian, after being asked to address concerns about ICU beds.;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;New Zealand coronavirus deaths during lockdown could be just 20, modelling suggests;Restrictions would need to remain in place until a vaccine or other treatment was developedNew Zealand coronavirus deaths during lockdown could be just 20, modelling suggestsJacinda Ardern has implored New Zealanders to “stay local” during a four-week countrywide lockdown as modelling showed that strict measures adopted by the country could limit deaths to 0.0004% of the population – or about 20 people.Research released by Te Pūnaha Matatini suggested that, left unchecked, the virus could eventually infect 89% of New Zealand’s population and kill up to 80,000 people in a worst-case scenario.According to the research, intensive care beds would reach capacity within two months and the number of patients needing intensive care would exceed 10 times capacity by the time the virus peaked.Ardern thanks nation as New Zealand adjusts to 'new normal' of Covid-19 lockdown Read moreHowever, with the strictest suppression measures, which the country has adopted, the fatalities would drop to just 0.0004%. Hospital capacity would not be exceeded for over a year. These measures included physical distancing, case isolation, household quarantine, and closing schools and universities and would require the restrictions to remain in place until a vaccine or other treatment was developed.However, researchers noted such strategies can “delay but not prevent the epidemic”.“When controls are lifted after 400 days, an outbreak occurs with a similar peak size as for an uncontrolled epidemic,” the researchers wrote.The government has currently mandated a four-week lockdown.In a briefing on Friday in Wellington, Ardern told the nation she did not want to see “the scenes of Bondi Beach in New Zealand”, where many kept going out despite the risk of contracting the virus. On Friday the country saw a record increase of 85 cases in one day.She told reporters that, despite the lockdown, the number of those infected with Covid-19 would continue to rise for some time.New Zealand is in day two of a four-week lockdown where non-essential businesses have been forced to close and families to stay home.“Don’t take road trips. Don’t go outside of your area. Don’t congregate,” Ardern said. “There is an expectation that people will stay in their homes.”Ardern said that those who were infected would not know for several days. If they broke their local “bubble” they would put many others, including the elderly, at risk.“Sadly, an increase in cases is expected. In fact, that is the whole reason why we are in a lockdown.”The prime minister sought to reassure New Zealanders that medical professionals had access to enough protective gear to manage demand across the country.Ardern said the border, which is closed to visitors, presented the greatest risk in managing Covid-19 and would be managed accordingly.Finance minister Grant Robertson also clarified that employers were required to pay employees a government wage subsidy, even if they cannot continue to employ them. This would take the support scheme to an estimated NZ$8-12bn.Earlier, director-general of health Ashley Bloomfield said New Zealand’s total number of patients with Covid-19 stood at 368.There were 76 confirmed cases and nine probable cases with eight people in hospitals across the country.Six of these patients were stable, and two are in intensive care units in Nelson and Wellington.A total of 37 individuals had now recovered.Bloomfield said that retired medical staff had also come forward to help in the effort, with more than 2,500 coming back into the workforce so far.Civil defence controller Sarah Stuart-Black said most New Zealanders had been obeying the rules around the country’s lockdown.There were isolated incidents of people congregating those people were spoken to and advised about what the restrictions mean.“We have a critical window to save lives and secure New Zealand’s future,” she said. “We understand this places strain on you and your families. The sacrifices you make will save lives.”Stuart-Black discouraged swimming or surfing where they might get in trouble and have to be rescued. “It’s a matter of judgment,” she said.;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;Bolsonaro's anti-science response to coronavirus appals Brazil's governors;The president has contradicted his own health ministry by urging people to return to work and schools – ‘I was gobsmacked,’ said one former Bolsonaro allyTop Brazilian politicians from across the political spectrum have warned that Jair Bolsonaro is putting thousands of lives at risk with what they called his reckless, paranoid, anti-scientific and belligerent response to the coronavirus.In a series of scathing interviews – conducted as 26 of Brazil’s 27 state governors convened an emergency meeting to discuss Bolsonaro’s behaviour – regional chiefs told the Guardian they feared the far-right leader was sowing confusion over the need for quarantine and social distancing measures, and wasting precious time setting political bonfires to energize his radical base.Bolsonaro says he 'wouldn't feel anything' if infected with Covid-19 and attacks state lockdowns Read moreBolsonaro sparked fury on Tuesday with an extraordinary address to the nation in which he rubbished the quarantine measures and travel restrictions being implemented by many state governors and urged Brazilians to return to work and schools – in contradiction of his own health ministry’s counsel.The comments stunned state governors – many of whom are now in open revolt against the president.“I was gobsmacked,” said Ronaldo Caiado, the rightwing governor of Goiás state and a former Bolsonaro ally.“It’s appalling. You cannot govern a country like this,” added Caiado, who this week severed ties with Bolsonaro. “At a moment like this he should have the humility to leave things to those who understand them.”Paulo Câmara, governor of the north-eastern state of Pernambuco, said regional chiefs were disappointed that “when every expert, from every country recommends staying at home … [Bolsonaro] goes on national TV and says this is an exaggeration, that distancing isn’t necessary, that the virus isn’t all that deadly, that it’s just ‘a little flu’.“We’re sorry that right now the central command is more interested in political and electoral questions than the health of the Brazilian people,” added Câmara, whose state has registered 46 cases and three deaths.Rui Costa, the Workers’ party governor of Bahia, said the country needed mature, professional and calm leadership – not ideology-infused grandstanding. “We cannot treat such a serious question in such a debauched manner,” he said.Facebook Twitter Pinterest An aerial view of a deserted Copacabana beach during the coronavirus outbreak, in Rio de Janeiro this week. Photograph: Ricardo Moraes/ReutersIn an open letter to Bolsonaro published after their summit on Wednesday, the rebel governors signalled they would ignore his calls to scale back their lockdowns.“Coronavirus is an adversary that must be defeated with good sense, empathy, balance and unity,” they wrote.In a second letter, the governors of Brazil’s nine north-eastern states declared: “Attacks and quarrels will not save the country.”Flávio Dino, the leftwing governor of the north-eastern state of Maranhão, said he believed Bolsonaro’s downplaying of the pandemic stemmed from a conviction that coronavirus was a political plot not a public health emergency.“Deep down it’s a kind of denialism. He thinks this is a media invention and a Chinese conspiracy which is part of their battle for hegemony with the US. He must have heard this from Trump,” said Dino, from the Brazilian Communist party.Brazilians protest over Bolsonaro's muddled coronavirus response Read more“That explains his resistance to these [lockdown] measures because deep, deep down he believes coronavirus is a communist invention,” added Dino, who said Bolsonaro’s jumbled response was risking lives.“He wastes so much time with these illusions, these deliriums, these conspiracies, these fantasies, these scuffles – and when you’re facing a serious crisis this is catastrophic,” Dino said.Câmara said Bolsonaro’s call to relax containment measures contradicted expert scientific consensus and would be disregarded. “As governors it is our duty to enforce these restrictions and follow the guidance of the World Health Organization … and this is what we will do,” he vowed.“Brazil isn’t ready for an exponential growth [in cases] so we need to buy time … so we can put together the infrastructure to treat as many infected people as possible.”Eduardo Leite, governor of the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, which has 162 confirmed cases, said lockdown was crucial so hospitals could prepare for a wave of Covid-19 patients.“[Bolsonaro] should be the one leading and coordinating this process. But not only is he not doing this, he’s actually sabotaging the plans state governments are putting in place,” added Leite, from the centre-right Brazilian Social Democracy party (PSDB).Leite said attacks on science and “political radicalism” would not solve the “extreme” crisis.One of those spearheading the mutiny is São Paulo’s governor, João Doria, a former Bolsonaro ally who many suspect harbours presidential ambitions.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Luiz Henrique Mandetta, the health minister, reacts during a press conference about coronavirus in Brasília.

Photograph: Andressa Anholete/Getty ImagesThis week, Doria clashed with Bolsonaro, accusing him of dividing Brazil at a time of national crisis. Brazil’s president hit back, bellowing “Your Excellency is an example to no one,” during a video conference.In turn, Doria warned that Bolsonaro’s behaviour could cost lives. “Lead your country. Lead your people,” he said.Coronavirus has set Brazilian politics alight, with Bolsonaro drawing heavy fire for dismissing the pandemic as media “hysteria”. On Thursday health officials said the number of cases had risen to 2,915 with 77 deaths.Renato Casagrande, the governor of Espírito Santo, which has 40 cases, said Bolsonaro’s address had stunned him.“I felt afraid. I couldn’t believe the words the president was saying. The health ministry has been guiding our response. The World Health Organization has been guiding our response. We are trying to convince people of the need right now for a greater confinement to stop the virus.

46;Coronavirus test kits withdrawn in Spain over poor accuracy rate;The Spanish government has withdrawn 9,000 Chinese-made coronavirus testing kits from use after it emerged that they had an accurate detection rate of just 30%.Like other countries struggling to diagnose and treat the virus, Spain has looked to China for rapid testing kits equipment and much-needed supplies, and announced this week that it would spend €432m (£390m) on tests, masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment.However, a batch of Chinese-made kits bought by Spanish health authorities a few weeks ago has been pulled after they were discovered to be unreliable and the Chinese government said they had been made by a company that did not appear on its list of authorised manufacturers.In a statement on Thursday, Spain’s health ministry said it would be returning the kits, but stressed that they had not been bought directly from the Chinese manufacturer but from a supply company in Spain that had purchased them in China and had provided the necessary accompanying paperwork.“The first tests on the rapid testing kits were carried out simultaneously by a hospital in Madrid and by the Carlos III Health Institute, and as soon as their low sensitivity was discovered, they were withdrawn,” said the ministry. “The supplier has been contacted and replacement tests will be provided.”Certificates shared by the ministry included an EU declaration of conformity for the products, which, according to the documentation, were made by the Shenzen Bioeasy Biotechnology Company Limited in Guandong province.Coronavirus mapped: which countries have the most cases and deaths? Read more“Spain follows EU regulations, which mean that if a product is certified to conform to European standards, it can be bought and sold throughout the union area,” said the statement.The ministry said the deficient kits were not part of the €432m Chinese order and had been bought before Chinese authorities had issued a list of approved manufacturers. In recent days, Spanish health authorities have been urgently distributing almost 650,000 rapid testing kits to frontline medical staff and residential homes for older people.Spain, which is the European country most affected by the coronavirus after Italy, has so far recorded more than 56,000 cases of the disease and more than 4,000 deaths.Health workers, who account for about 14% of the country’s coronavirus victims, have complained of a lack of basic protective equipment such as face masks and gowns.;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
47;Back poor countries fighting Covid-19 with trillions or face disaster, G20 told;"Economists and global health experts have called on G20 leaders to provide trillions of dollars to poorer countries to shore up ailing healthcare systems and economies, or face a disaster that will rebound on wealthier states through migration and health crises.Twenty experts, among them four Nobel prizewinners, including Joseph Stiglitz, Lord Nicholas Stern and seven chief economists of the World Bank and other development banks, have written to G20 leaders to warn of “unimaginable health and social impacts” as coronavirus rips through the developing world, taking overburdened healthcare systems beyond breaking point, and causing economic and social devastation.Countries are “falling apart because of the collapse in commodity prices, tourism and remittances”, said the signatories, even before the ravages of the virus itself takes hold across south-east Asia, Latin America and Africa, where at least 43 out of 54 countries have confirmed cases.The G20 held a virtual meeting by video conference on Thursday to discuss the Covid-19 crisis.Poorer countries are likely to be hit harder than rich states, since they have less capacity to absorb the shock and overcrowding, poor infrastructure and lack of resources hamper public health efforts. Basic hygiene and a lack of handwashing facilities and soap will be a major issue for poorer people.“Developing countries are facing an unprecedented collective threat to human life, social cohesion and economic devastation,” the letter to the G20 leaders said. “Massive economic losses will be incurred as countries desperately try to cope, people will migrate out of fear as the epidemic takes hold, leading to social disruption, violence and security issues.”The group wants swift action to devote emergency spending to stricken developing countries, and longer-term reforms that make nations more resilient to outbreaks and natural disasters.At least $8bn (£6.5bn) in emergency funding has been requested by the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board, but that should be just the beginning according to the letter’s signatories, who make it clear that the money required will be “of a different order of magnitude” to the amounts pledged so far.The US is implementing a rescue package worth about $2tn, the UK government is spending more than £330bn on its recovery, and other countries are coming up with packages of their own. Poorer nations will need far greater levels of assistance than have yet been planned, according to the letter.Erik Berglof, director of the Institute of Global Affairs at the London School of Economics, and an organiser of the letter, told the Guardian: “If it will take more than $2tn, perhaps as much as $6tn, to fix the US, we are not going to fix the rest of the world for less. To attach a specific number now is almost meaningless. What we need are new and creative ways of using the global financial muscle to back up existing international financial institutions.”He said that emergency resources and medical help could be provided quickly, but it was important to manage the process with a long-term view, expanding existing international institutions and programmes. “You cannot sprinkle money from helicopters in these economies because it would never reach the intended receivers,” he said. “You need carefully managed programmes and projects that can help these countries through this extremely difficult period.”Infrastructure investment would be vital to ensure recovery from a shock that, the economists said, would be greater than that of the 2008 financial crisis.'We fear, but have to work': isolation not an option for the poor of Nairobi Read moreIf efforts to control Covid-19 fail, “the virus could become endemic, producing new waves of destructive outbreaks around the world”, the letter warned, adding: “We have a rapidly closing window to ensure that we give these countries at least a fighting chance to manage the crisis and provide some light at the end of what could be a long tunnel.”The letter concludes: “We are now urging you, the leaders of the G20, to urgently provide the necessary resources to reduce the losses in human life and back up those most vulnerable. The required investment is minute compared to the social and economic costs of inaction. History will judge us harshly if we do not get this right.”The signatories are: Kaushik Basu, former World Bank chief economist; Erik Berglof, former chief economist of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development; Tim Besley, former president of the International Economic Association; Victor Dzau, president of the US National Academy of Medicine; Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust; Ahmed Galal, former finance minister of Egypt; Sergei Guriev, former EBRD chief economist; Bengt Holmström, Nobel laureate; Anne Krueger, former World Bank chief economist; Justin Lin, former World Bank chief economist; Nora Lustig, co-founder of the Latin and Caribbean Economic Association; Ngozi Okonjo-Awala, former managing director of the World Bank; Christopher Pissarides, Nobel laureate; Dani Rodrik, incoming president of the International Economic Association; Michael Spence, Nobel laureate; Nicholas Stern, former World Bank chief economist; Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel laureate; Andrés Velasco, former finance minister of Chile; Leonard Wantchekon, founder of the African School of Economics; Shang-Jin Wei, former Asian Development Bank chief economist.";REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
48;Even if Trump wanted to reopen the economy, it's not clear he could | Nick Obradovich and Renee C Wurth;Should we reopen the US economy in a couple of weeks? Both sides of the argument have their merits. We need to put US workers back to work as quickly as possible to slow the economic damage inflicted by mass physical distancing policies. We also must minimize US deaths from the coronavirus outbreak. Barring a miracle cure, experts markedly disagree about how best to strike the balance.But even if it were deemed optimal, can America realistically reopen our economy right now?Economic hurdlesWe’re possibly facing a 1918-style pandemic if we relax physical distancing and a Great Depression-level economic shock if we don’t. Yet our economy today is dramatically different from that of the early 20th century.American goods and services are reliant on the output of other countries around the world, whose production is in turn dependent on the output of still other nations, and so on. We can’t successfully put American companies back to work unless other countries simultaneously do the same with their domestic industries.Production of US automobiles, for example, simply won’t be feasible until nations that produce required components also reopen. And if US automakers can’t source the materials they need for domestic production, related service companies – like marketing firms – won’t have much work, either. If marketing companies have little to market, online advertising giants such as Google and Facebook will in turn see limited revenues.Our global economy is remarkably interconnected. Pull out an important thread, and the whole tapestry of our production system unravels.This economic interdependence necessitates all parts working in harmony. Unfortunately, the pandemic is asynchronous – it hits countries at different times with different rates of growth and severity. While China is reopening, India and the US are shuttering. If portions of Chinese production require unavailable intermediate goods from India or the US, such production won’t be possible. Even if China can produce items for export, if their normal buyers in the US are closed, who will they sell to? And what happens when China – still lacking herd immunity – needs to close its economy again right when India or the US are looking to reopen and use Chinese inputs?The staggered nature of the virus outbreak coupled with worldwide production presents a remarkable – and quite possibly insurmountable – global coordination problem. Globalized on-demand supply chains simply aren’t well suited for a worldwide pandemic.Political hurdlesThe economic argument for reopening US production assumes that it would be broadly socially acceptable to sacrifice the lives of Americans to save our economy – and that politicians will therefore be willing to pursue it. We suspect, to the contrary, that premature reopening will soon be revealed as political suicide.Once the lag in deaths catches up to the exponentially increasing number of cases in the US, myriad heart-wrenching stories of the lives of those lost will ensue. And while the economy certainly matters to voters, we suspect that any politician that wants to win re-election is highly unlikely to push workers back to offices and factories while obituaries are overflowing and we’re using skating rinks to store our dead. Explicitly putting a price on lives will probably be even more impolitic in the coming weeks than it is today.Psychological hurdleCrises like the coronavirus pandemic also alter our individual choices, behaviors and attitudes. Before the virus arrives, it can seem abstract, distant and even unthreatening to an uncritical or untrained eye. Yet its speed and severity take many by surprise as it rapidly runs through communities. The marked difference between expectations and reality exacts a heavy psychological toll.Once the coronavirus touches citizens’ lives, they are quite unlikely to immediately switch back into status-quo behavior. Even if officials were to remove restrictions on movement and social gatherings, we suspect most people will continue to limit non-essential outings. How many residents of Bergamo, Italy, want to spend time in crowded shops or restaurants right now? Our guess is: very, very few. If you knew coronavirus was still ravaging your city, would you head out to the barber shop or go to a concert?Many normal activities, from the enjoyable to the mundane, now produce some level of anxiety. That association won’t be undone overnight, and fear is a remarkably powerful deterrent to economic activity.So, should we restart our economy while the virus is still rapidly spreading? Regardless of whether it’s a necessary evil or a terrible atrocity of an idea, we probably can’t.;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;Millions of Americans are about to lose their health insurance in a pandemic | Wendell Potter;The tragic effects of our battle with the novel coronavirus are seemingly endless. But arguably the most mind-blowing is this: the very pandemic that threatens to infect and kill millions is simultaneously causing many to also lose their health coverage at their gravest time of need.Here’s how: the virus has caused a public health crisis so severe that people have been forced to stay home, causing businesses to shutter and lay off workers. And with roughly half of Americans getting their health insurance from their employer, these layoffs mean not only losing their income but also their medical coverage. In other words, just as our need for medical care skyrockets in the face of a global pandemic, fewer will have health insurance or be able to afford it. According to one recent report, the cost of treatment for Covid-19 can run around $35,000. As the patient in the report exclaimed: “I was pretty sticker-shocked. I personally don’t know anybody who has that kind of money.”So, how did we get to such a dire place? Many will sadly lose their jobs over the coming weeks – with one estimate projecting as many as 30%. And as they do, Americans are about to learn something horrifying: how irrational and irresponsible it is for so many to be dependent on employers for health insurance. Take it from me. I’m a former health insurance executive who once profited from this system. It’s time for it to stop.America needs to finally get out of the business of linking health coverage to job status. Even in better times, this arrangement was a bad idea from a health perspective. Most Americans whose families depend on their employers for coverage are just a layoff away from being uninsured. And now, when many businesses are shutting down and considering layoffs, it’s a public health disaster. Across the country we’re seeing reports of layoffs in almost all industries. As we approach a global recession, some analysts suggest that a million or more US workers will lose their jobs in April alone. Consider what this means for health care in this country.We’ve seen this before. During the last big recession, researchers at Cornell University found that 9.3 million Americans lost their health insurance between 2007 and 2009. Why? As people lost work, their employer-provided insurance went away. During this time, roughly six in 10 Americans who lost their jobs became uninsured. And this problem compounds itself. If the reason you lost your health insurance is that you no longer have steady employment, how are you now going to be able to afford monthly premiums for some other private health care plan? This problem becomes particularly acute when you consider that premiums for health plans sold on exchanges are projected to soar, as well, due to “unexpected Covid-19 costs”.It’s worth noting that even in good times, the employer-based model fails to cover enough of us, with the number of Americans covered through an employer steadily dropping in general. Since 1999, the percentage of those with job-based coverage has declined by nine points. And it most certainly will drop like a rock in the coming weeks and months.It’s now clear that this system cannot handle our current reality. With so many Americans sadly on the verge of unemployment, the number that will lose health coverage will be crushing. As we rebuild our country’s economic base and reimagine the roles various industries play in our new future, we must also begin a difficult conversation about health care. If we’re dependent on jobs in order to have it, a lot of us will be left out in the cold. And at a time in our nation’s history where more will need quality care than ever before, the human cost will simply be too much to bear.;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;Working from home during coronavirus is not a privilege everyone has | Mona Chalabi;Only one in four US workers have a job that allows them to work from home, according to a 2017-18 surveyAs the coronavirus cases continue to rise in America, the US government has advised people to work from home. But working from home is not a privilege everyone has.Only one in four US workers have a job that allows them to work from home according to the American Time Use Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The survey, which was last conducted in 2017-18 asked workers aged 15 and over whether they were able to work from home and just 28% said yes.Of course, Covid-19 is likely to change these numbers, as many employers are forced to rethink their business practices completely. However, the survey still gives an insight into who in the US has greater employment flexibility in these difficult times.The industry where workers were most likely to say they could work from home was financial activities (ironically, also the industry where employees are highly likely to have savings to tide them over during a period of employment). Not only did 57% of people who work in finance say that they could work from home, but 47% said they did work from home and were paid for doing so.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Mona Chalabi/The GuardianAfter finance, those working in professional and business services were most likely to say they could work from home (53%) followed by information (also 53%). The industries where workers found it most difficult to work from home were leisure and hospitality (just 9% of whom were able to work from home), as well as agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting (11%).The survey also reveals other trends in who can and cannot work from home. Perhaps unsurprisingly, those on the lowest incomes are least likely to be able to work from home – just 9% of workers who had earnings in the lowest 25th percentile said they could work from home, compared with 62% of workers in the highest 25th percentile. Full-time workers were twice as likely as part-time workers to say that they can work from home.While 40% of Asian workers could work from home, that rate was 30% for white workers and 20% for black workers. Hispanic workers were half as likely as non-Hispanic workers to be able to work from home (16% compared with 31%).;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
51;Will the coronavirus 'kill populism'? Don't count on it | Cas Mudde;While epidemiologists are still trying to come to grips with the severity of the coronavirus pandemic, with different models predicting different outcomes, the pundits are already certain “coronavirus will change the world permanently”. Social and traditional media are also full of hot takes, mostly that coronavirus will change globalization “hugely for the better” and that it could “kill populism”.Unlike these pundits, I don’t have a crystal ball, but comparative analysis and historical experience warn against such big expectations. On the former, let’s just look back a mere 10 years, and see how much “globalization” has changed since the Great Recession. The answer is: not much. In the US, banks are bigger than ever, Wall Street is handing out near-record bonuses again, and almost no one of significance went to jail.But if the structures remain unaffected, will the players be changed? Will “populism” be the “next victim” of coronavirus? Many hundreds of columns have been written about the “incompetent” and “dangerous” responses by Boris Johnson and Donald Trump, who, we are told, have shown us the “limits of populism”. But, despite the obsessive coverage of these two leaders, they are not the only populist leaders – they are and not even the best examples of populists.If we look a little bit further, we see very different responses by populists around the world. There are some highly prominent examples of the stereotypical approach, ie populists denying reality, distracting the public with conspiracy theories and offering slow and halfhearted policies. Far-right presidents like Trump and his Brazilian wannabe, Jair Bolsonaro, are much-cited examples, though the Mexican president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a nominal leftwing populist, is hardly better.But other populists have taken the threat much more seriously. In fact, in the Netherlands, the populist radical right Forum for Democracy (FvD) and Party for Freedom (PVV) have criticized the mainstream coalition government of conservative Mark Rutte for being too lax, and have been urging him for weeks to not just close the borders, but adopt similar “lockdown” policies to those most other EU countries have enforced. And let us not forget that the hardest-hit country in Europe, Italy, which has in many ways set the tone for responses elsewhere on the continent, is governed by a coalition of the center-left Democratic party and the populist Five Star Movement.Similarly, in India, Narendra Modi, one of Trump’s biggest allies and the leader of the largest populist radical right party in the world, has locked down his country of 1.3 billion people for 21 days. “Every state, every district, every lane, every village will be under lockdown,” Modi stated. To be fair, this kills two birds with one stone, as his government has faced mass street protests over a host of issues in recent months, which will now become impossible.Other populist leaders have used the coronavirus to push through authoritarian “emergency measures” too. Viktor Orbán is continuing his transformation of Hungary into an authoritarian regime with draconic new measures, while Benjamin Netanyahu has used the coronavirus to execute an autogolpe (self-coup) in Israel, suspending the courts and parliament. But many non-populist leaders have declared states of emergency too, whereas some populists, including surprisingly Trump, have (so far) done little.In short, there is not one single “populist response” to the coronavirus pandemic. There is not even a single “rightwing populist response”. Populist parties and politicians have responded very differently, in part depending upon whether they are in government or opposition. They are also faced with very different contexts, both in terms of number of infections and control of the media.For example, while Johnson and Trump are criticized daily by the majority of their respective national media, and have to rely on the uncritical loyalty of their supportive conservative media complex, populist radical right leaders in Hungary and Poland have full control of the state media, which boast about the low level of infections, without telling their audience about the low level of tests in the country.It is far too early to make grand predictions on how the coronavirus will change the world. But we can already say that it will almost certainly not “kill populism”, for the simple reason that “populism” does not have one, unitary response to the pandemic. Based on recent historical experience, I would put my money on the coronavirus crisis having at best a moderate overall effect on populists: some will win, some will lose and some will stay the same.;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

54;Bob Dylan releases first original song in eight years, 17-minute track about JFK;Singer says Murder Most Foul, ‘recorded a while back’, is a gift to fans for their support and loyalty over the yearsBob Dylan has released his first original music in eight years, a 17-minute long song about the JFK assassination.A ballad set to piano, strings and light drums, Murder Most Foul retells the 1963 killing in stark terms, imagining Kennedy “being led to the slaughter like a sacrificial lamb … they blew off his head while he was still in the car / shot down like a dog in broad daylight.” He paints an epic portrait of an America in decline ever since, but offered salvation of a sort in pop music: the Beatles, Woodstock festival, Charlie Parker, the Eagles and Stevie Nicks are all referenced in its lyrics.Dylan made subtle reference to the coronavirus crisis as he launched the song on Twitter. “Greetings to my fans and followers with gratitude for all your support and loyalty across the years,” he said. “This is an unreleased song we recorded a while back that you might find interesting. Stay safe, stay observant and may God be with you.”Dylan’s recent albums have featured cover versions of American pop standards. The most recent was triple album Triplicate in 2017. His last album of original songs was Tempest in 2012.Murder Most Foul is also the first original song he has released since he became the first songwriter to be awarded the Nobel prize for literature, in 2016.;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
55;Bob Dylan: Murder Most Foul review – a dark, dense ballad for the end times;As with pretty much anything Bob Dylan does these days, you can only speculate at his reasons for unexpectedly releasing a 17-minute song, ostensibly about the assassination of John F Kennedy, that gradually turns into a litany of cultural references taking in everything from Shakespeare to Stevie Nicks to silent-movie comedians, from the Moonlight Sonata to Jelly Roll Morton to A Nightmare on Elm Street.And – as with pretty much anything Bob Dylan has ever done – speculate people have. They’ve suggested it’s a harbinger of his first album of original material since 2012. That it’s an outtake from his last album of original songs, Tempest, that’s noticeably better than anything on Tempest, and Dylan has form in leaving the best song off an album: this is, after all, the man who came to the conclusion that Shot of Love was better without Caribbean Wind on it, and Infidels somehow improved by removing Blind Willie McTell.People have mooted that it’s a standalone release, appearing now because Dylan understandably thinks it’s timely, March 2020 being a pretty apropos moment to release an epic song filled with death and horror and apocalyptic dread (“The age of the antichrist has just begun … it’s 36 hours past judgment day”), or perhaps to give his diehard fans further incentive to stay indoors. You rather get the feeling some of them will still be self-isolating months after the coronavirus all-clear has sounded, delicately unpicking its manifold knotty allusions – the line about playing it for Carl Wilson down Gower Avenue requires the listener to know that the late Beach Boy sang backing vocals on Desperados Under the Eaves, the concluding track from Warren Zevon’s eponymous 1976 album, which ended with the line “look away down Gower Avenue” – and arguing on message boards as to whether the Susie mentioned midway through is just a reference to the Everly Brothers, or to Suze Rotolo, the girlfriend with whom Dylan watched the aftermath of Kennedy assassination unfolding, holed up in their New York apartment.For a song that lasts 17 minutes, there isn’t a great deal to Murder Most Foul musically. The arrangement hovers atmospherically in the distance, a haze of tumbling piano, lightly struck drums and violin, its softness at odds with the tone of the lyrics. One comparison currently being bandied about is to Don McLean’s American Pie, itself a kind of bubblegum populist take on Dylan’s oblique referential songs of the 60s, but American Pie had a catchy tune and a singalong chorus. Here, there’s nothing that even vaguely resembles a standard structure and Dylan swiftly abandons any pretence of there being a vocal melody: it’s essentially a recitation set to music.Bob Dylan releases first original song in eight years, 17-minute track about JFK Read moreThe point is clearly the lyrics, which are dense and intriguing enough to hold your interest, and give the listener plenty to digest. Quite aside from all the cultural references, there’s a narrator that keeps switching from Kennedy himself to Dylan, who in turn seems to keep switching from firebrand mode to the grimly resigned old grouch of Things Have Changed and It’s All Good (“I hate to tell you Mister but only dead men are free”) and a plethora of details about the assassination itself: “Don’t say Dallas don’t love you, Mr President” is a mangling of the last words spoken to Kennedy by Nellie Connally, the first lady of Texas.The JFK assassination looms large in Dylan’s history, despite his assurance that “I didn’t feel it more than anybody else … the whole thing about my reaction to the assassination is overplayed”. Certainly, it bothered him enough to give a rambling speech at an awards ceremony shortly afterwards saying he “saw something of himself” in Lee Harvey Oswald. (He was roundly booed.) He also subsequently visited the assassination site and indeed wrote about it, albeit in a sheaf of unpublished typescripts that were auctioned in the 90s. And it’s clearly been bothering him more recently: a 2012 exhibition of his paintings featured one of Oswald and one of Oswald’s killer, Jack Ruby.Is the litany of music, film and literature that consumes the song’s second half intended to suggest its author thinks art is a meaningless distraction at moments of tragedy, or vitally important? The condescending tone of “Hush little children, you’ll understand / the Beatles are coming, they want to hold your hand” implies the former, although the very timing of Murder Most Foul’s release suggests it’s the latter.

The cause of the fire is still under investigation.More than 100 firefighters responded to the station, the spokesman said, describing the scene as “challenging” and “dark” It took about a half-hour to extinguish the fire.The fire disrupted service to several train lines, causing delays as the MTA contends with dramatically reduced ridership and service cuts amid the coronavirus outbreak.;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
57;Rightwing thinktanks use fear of Covid-19 to fight bans on plastic bags;"The fight to ban plastic bags, many of which end up polluting oceans and rivers, has taken a step backward as conservative US think-tanks exploit the fear of Covid-19, campaigners have said.Articles warning that reusable cloth bags are worse than plastic ones for spreading coronavirus have been linked to major rightwing nonprofits such as the Manhattan Institute, and contain misinformation aimed at defeating or repealing plastic bag bans, said Greenpeace USA.The effort “risks further confusion” amid a global public health crisis, it said.Recent studies have found that Covid-19 could be stable on plastic and steel for up to three days, compared with 24 hours for cardboard and four hours for copper. The studies have not examined how long the virus remained on cloth and there is little scientific evidence comparing reusable bags with plastic.Last week a number of US states and cities nevertheless took the decision to roll back plastic bag bans, citing the coronavirus. Maine repealed its ban. The governor of New Hampshire went further by issuing an order banning reusable bags, saying they risk spreading coronavirus. The governor of Massachusetts banned reusable bags and lifted plastic bag bans. And New York state, which implemented its plastic bag ban on 1 March, will delay enforcement until June.The moves come after a lobbying effort by groups including the Manhattan Institute and the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), a libertarian nonprofit instrumental in persuading the Trump administration to abandon the Paris climate agreement.While nonprofits are not required to disclose their donors, both have reportedly received money from fossil fuel companies. Among the sponsors for a CEI gala last year were the Charles Koch Institute and the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers association, the New York Times reported.Greenpeace USA criticised the Manhattan Institute and the CEI for a series of articles suggesting that reusable bags are a higher risk for transmitting coronavirus than plastic bags, misrepresenting recent research that shows the virus survives at least as long on plastic.Such misinformation is already being used to lobby state legislatures to defeat or repeal plastic bag ban legislation, it said.John Hocevar, Greenpeace USA’s oceans campaigner, condemned what he described as industry groups that have “seen the crisis as an opportunity to exploit people’s fears around Covid-19 to push their pro-pollution agendas”.“Even in the short term, plastic does not inherently make something clean and safe, and we should not confuse corporate public relations with factual medical research,” Hocevar said.New York was the third US state to outlaw non-biodegradable carrier bags, but the ban is yet to be enforced. Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFPSimilar moves are under way in Britain, where the environment secretary, George Eustice, has waived the 5p charge on plastic bags for supermarket shoppers online. Eustice said it was a temporary measure aimed at reducing potential cross-infection between delivery workers and those in isolation, and to speed up deliveries.Plans to further reduce single-use plastic, under the environment bill, have been put on hold due to Covid-19.The Welsh government’s plans to reduce single-use plastic are also under review due to the pandemic, it told the Guardian.In the US, the misinformation campaign against reusable bags ramped up after two recent studies. The first, from the University of California, published last month in the Journal of Hospital Infection, reported that viruses similar to Covid-19 could remain on plastic for up to nine days. The second, published on 17 March in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that Covid-19 could be stable on plastic for up to three days. The viruses could be inactivated by disinfection. Neither study examined fabric.However, the day after the first study was published, the Plastics Industry Association wrote to the US Department for Health and Human Services, urging the government to make a pronouncement supporting single-use plastic. The association claimed “study after study” showed reusable bags to be a health risk. It did not mention the University of California study.Then, on 12 March, the Manhattan Institute authored an article in the City Journal claiming: “The ‘sustainable’ bags that environmentalists and politicians have been so eager to impose on the public … can sustain the Covid-19 and flu viruses and spread the virus throughout the store.”The piece, headlined “Greening our way to infection” and written by John Tierney, cites unnamed research that Tierney claims showed viruses and bacteria can survive on tote bags for nine days. It offers no evidence to back this claim – in fact, it links to a study showing viruses can remain on plastic for nine days.The piece also quotes a 2018 study published in the Journal of Environmental Health where researchers found traces of a surrogate virus on surfaces and the hands of shoppers and store staff high enough “to risk transmission”. They recommended in-store hand hygiene and washing reuseable bags. They did not compare the risk of reusable bags with new plastic bags.Another piece by Tierney, with a similar argument, appeared in the New York Post entitled “Using tote bags instead of plastic could help spread coronavirus”.Meanwhile, the Washington Examiner published a piece by Angela Logomasini of the Competitive Enterprise Institute on 18 March, a day after the New England Journal of Medicine study, headlined: “Plastic bag bans aren’t helping us fight against coronavirus”.Logomasini quotes the same 2018 study as Tierney, as well as a 2011 study on reusable and plastic bags that looked at bacteria, not viruses, and was partly funded by the American Chemistry Council.Ivy Schlegel, a researcher at Greenpeace USA, said: “This is a classic PR tactic. After new studies showing Covid-19 lasts longer on plastic, they have pulled back into their bag of tricks to redeploy old studies, linking them to legitimate public fear of the coronavirus.”Hocevar said: “The truth is that we don’t have all of the answers to this Covid-19 emergency yet, and for industry to use this as an opportunity to increase profits for the fossil fuel and plastics sectors is dangerous and irresponsible.“What we do know is that there is no substitute for strict hygiene. Just because a material is made from single-use plastic does not make it less likely to transmit viral infections during use; in fact, plastic surfaces appear to allow coronaviruses to remain infectious for particularly long periods compared to other materials.”“The decisions we make for our families in this health crisis should be based on science and the advice of medical professionals, not lobbyists for the fossil fuel and plastics industries. Wherever reusables are an option, it is incumbent upon all of us to do our part to protect one another by washing them thoroughly after every use.”Greenpeace USA have said reusables should continue to be used wherever they are an option. Photograph: Mary Altaffer/APA spokesperson for the Manhattan Institute said: “A clear reading of Mr Tierney’s City Journal article shows support of his argument by multiple scientific studies on the use of reusable bags in supermarkets. We stand by the integrity of Mr Tierney’s journalism and will continue to publish articles that shed light on various aspects of this pandemic that we are all going through together.”In a response to the Guardian, Logomasini, a senior fellow at the CEI, defended her Washington Examiner article. She said: “Greenpeace’s assertions that promoting clean single-use plastic bags over reusable ones exploits Covid-19 fears and is part of a pro-pollution agenda are ridiculous.“It’s clearly helpful – not exploitative – for people to point out the relative risks associated with reusable grocery bags and single-use plastic bags. Greenpeace basically admits that the reusable bags can harbour dangerous pathogens, including Covid-19, by explaining that people should wash them after every use.”A CEI spokesperson said: “Angela Logomasini is a well-respected expert with 30 years of working on plastic issues. Her positions are developed independently and are not influenced by the views of our supporters. The Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by thousands of individuals, businesses and foundations around the globe, and we respect their privacy.”";REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, the suspects had fled the scene by the time officers arrived. Neighbours described the intruders as three white males who drove away in a silver vehicle.It is believed the suspects forced entry into the rear of the premises, where they stole the firearms – estimated to be worth more than £100,000.Facebook Twitter Pinterest A deactivated Beretta Tomcat used by Pierce Brosnan in Die Another Day and reported stolen this week.

Our contractors follow government advice on limiting the spread of covid-19, including social distancing and hand washing.”Facebook Twitter Pinterest A site of national importance ... the album cover for Abbey Road. Photograph: Pictorial Press/Alamy Stock PhotoThe brightened markings can be seen in action on the Abbey Road webcam.The government designated the crossing a site of national importance in 2010 and it can be altered only with the approval of local authorities. “This London zebra crossing is no castle or cathedral but, thanks to the Beatles and a 10-minute photoshoot one August morning in 1969, it has just as strong a claim as any to be seen as part of our heritage,” John Penrose, minister for tourism and heritage said at the time.The remaining Beatles, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Abbey Road album with a deluxe reissue last September. In January, it was announced as the biggest selling vinyl record of the 2010s in the US. It came eighth in the UK, with British Beatles fans apparently preferring Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.The cover for Abbey Road was shot at 11.35am on 8 August 1969, as John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr took a break from completing I Want You (She’s So Heavy) and The End, and Paul McCartney paused work on Oh!

61;Japan Airlines ditches compulsory high heels and skirts in big win for #KuToo movement;Company becomes first major employer in the country to stop forcing dress code on womenFemale flight attendants working for Japan Airlines will no longer be required to wear high heels or skirts, the airline has said, in a rare victory for Japan’s #KuToo campaign against workplace dress codes for women.The airline is the first major Japanese company to relax its regulations in response to complaints from women that having to wear high heels was uncomfortable and often left them in considerable pain.Japan Airlines (JAL) said that under its new dress code, which will take effect next month, almost 6,000 female crew members would be able to choose footwear that “best fits their needs” and swap their skirts for trousers, adding that the move was intended to create a “diverse working environment”.The airline’s decision was welcomed by Yumi Ishikawa, an actor and writer who is credited with starting the #KuToo movement – a play on #MeToo that combines the Japanese words for shoes (kutsu) and pain (kutsuu).#KuToo: Japanese women submit anti-high heels petition Read more“It’s a great step given that Japan Airlines is such a big company,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.“It’s not only airlines – there are also hotels, department stores, banks and a lot of other companies with this requirement. I hope they follow this example,” added Ishikawa, who triggered the campaign last year with a tweet about being forced to wear high heels for her part-time job at a funeral parlour.Other Japanese companies are unlikely to follow suit, however. Most firms whose business entails customer service, including banks and airlines, force women to wear high heels, according to a poll last year by the Kyodo news agency.Another survey found that more than 60% of women had been told to wear high heels or had witnessed female colleagues being forced to wear them. More than 80% said the footwear had caused them physical discomfort.The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has said he opposes workplace dress codes for women, but Takumi Nemoto, who was health, labour and welfare minister when the #KuToo campaign started, said they were “necessary and appropriate” and were “generally accepted by society”.The movement has since expanded to include demands for the right to wear glasses at work, after a TV report about companies that forced women to wear contact lenses sparked outrage on social media.The hashtag “glasses are forbidden” trended on Twitter, with one user, who worked in a restaurant, complaining that she had been repeatedly told not to wear glasses because she would appear “rude”, and they did not match her kimono.;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;Mexican governor prompts outrage with claim poor are immune to coronavirus;A Mexican state governor has prompted incredulity and outrage by claiming that poor people are immune to Covid-19, as the government attempts to promote physical distancing and cancels non-essential services.Miguel Barbosa, the governor of Puebla, was apparently commenting on reports that a significant proportion of Mexico’s coronavirus cases is made up of wealthy people who had travelled abroad.Officials say three-quarters of Mexico’s 475 confirmed cases are related to international travel, including several people who reportedly caught the virus on skiing trips to Italy or the US.“Most of them are wealthy people,” Barbosa said. “If you are rich you are at risk. If you are poor you are not. The poor, we’re immune.”His comments sparked controversy in a country where nearly half of the population are poor and the majority work in the informal economy.They also reflected the almost conspiratorial response of many Mexican politicians toward Covid-19, which threatens to wreck the government’s agenda of mega-projects and expanding social programmes.The country’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, whose administration has promised to “put the poor first”, has responded with breezy optimism to the crisis. He told reporters on Tuesday that Mexico would be past the “worst of it” within a month.López Obrador has resisted stiffer measures, such as quarantine and border closures, on the grounds that poor Mexicans are unable to afford not to work.Coronavirus advice from Mexico's president: 'Live life as usual' Read more“The economy is in a nosedive and his base, the poor, is getting the short end of the stick,” Esteban Illades, the editor of Nexos magazine, said of the president’s motives. “A weak economy means his legacy is compromised.”Mexico has entered phase two of the coronavirus pandemic, meaning community spreading has started. There have been six deaths in the country so far.Covid-19 has struck at a tough time for Mexico. The economy slumped in 2019 and forecasts for 2020 suggested continued stagnation even before the pandemic.López Obrador swept to power with an overwhelming majority in 2018, but recent polls suggest his support is slipping. One survey showed his approval rating below 50% for the first time.The president’s supporters have rallied around him and tried to downplay the dangers of the coronavirus.Analysts say the pandemic is the most recent in a string of crises, including outbreaks of drug violence and growing fury over gender-based violence, which López Obrador and his supporters see as personal attacks rather than issues requiring urgent attention and resources.Illades said: “They’re looking at how coronavirus will affect their so-called ‘fourth transformation’,” as the president refers to his administration, “and how their dreams of transforming the country are now on the backburner. It happens every presidential term. Reality always gets in the way of dreams.”;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;Confined in rental apartments, millennials decorate virtual homes;"Out of a desperate desire to avoid the doom-and-gloom news reel for at least a few hours a day and with Covid-19 keeping me confined at home, I have become interiors-obsessed. There’s no more pleasant distraction than searching for the perfect rug to really pull a room together, debating variations of patterned wallpaper, or agonizing over exactly how many scatter cushions are too many scatter cushions.An hour or two a day can easily be wiled away planning a whole-house refurbishment. The only problem is, like most young people, I don’t actually own a home that I can decorate. Instead, I’ve been sucked into the world of decorating apps, and their creators have been expecting people like me – permanently renting millennials, AKA “Generation Rent”.The popularity of interior design apps is understandable. Although 80% of millennials would like to eventually own a home, homeownership rates among people under 35 in the US have fallen by 20% in the last decade. The economic uncertainties that we are facing today – with mounting student debts, the rise of the gig economy and a seemingly impending recession – make mortgages seem even more out of reach. Personalizing a house may have been a luxury that older generations enjoyed in real life, but for many young people tapping away at our phone screens may be as close as we can get.This less-than-perfect reality has spurred a meteoric rise of apps to fulfill us digitally. Design Home is one of the most popular interior design apps, with over 75m downloads and at least 1 million daily users. Players are given daily “challenges” of decorating different rooms, with a vast range of furniture to choose from. Virtual cash and rewards are handed out daily, and can also be won based on a rating system.Although the app is free, users can also purchase in-game currency to perk up lackluster rooms with more expensive items – and there’s certainly the temptation to do so. After all, players’ designs are directly pitted against each other, as users vote for their favorite designs of the day, with top designs receiving more highly prized rewards. Enter enough challenges, and you’ll receive the requisite amount of points to be able to decorate an entire house, a much-prized reward that can take weeks of playing steadily to acquire. There are scores of similar apps currently on the market, each racking up hundreds of thousands of users carefully crafting their own video-game-style homes.“Now, more than ever before, people are spending more time at home ‘nesting’, and surroundings can make a difference in our happiness,” explains Design Home’s creator Chris McGill. “People may not be able to decorate and customize their own homes, but still wish to cultivate their creativity and express themselves through interior design.”As social media have encouraged us to share pictures of perfectly color-coordinated rooms with total strangers, our homes are no longer a private space – they are frequently photographed and regularly fill up our feeds with #instagramworthy style. Interior design apps fill the gap between our increasingly high aesthetic aspirations and the reality of rentals.“I think [interior design games] satisfy our need to see beautiful design and interact with it in a very personal way,” explains Alessandra Wood, a design historian and the vice-president of Modsy, an online interior design service that allows buyers to see digital renderings of their room before they make purchases. “Over the past few years, as home design has shifted into the spotlight thanks to Instagram and Pinterest, interior design games allow users to play and experiment with interior design – two things nearly impossible to achieve without time, effort and money in real life.”It seems that home decorating apps have arisen at a culturally serendipitous time for their creators. Interior design for the masses has become mainstream at the very moment that homeownership has plummeted, and apps like Design Home have sprung up in its place. But Design Home also experiments with new models of marketing, raising interesting questions about how game play and consumerism could interact in future. Many of the items available in the game are also for sale in the real world, with users able to click through to connect to various websites to purchase items.“Design Home is changing the way consumers connect, learn and engage with the interior design industry and how brands meaningfully reach consumers through creative gameplay,” explains McGill. “With any new product, it’s important to start with a thesis about an unmet consumer need. Interior design is already a creative passion for millions of people but may not be accessible in people’s daily lives. Creating Design Home was a way to connect players and makers; giving players access to styles and furniture from all over the world and exposing furniture makers to passionate customers.”With large swaths of Design Home’s audience seemingly drawn to the app by the limitations of their own living situation, and with scant information currently available on the success of the model, it is unclear how much interior design apps manage to monetize this marketing scheme, or whether most of their income is made through small in-app purchases, with users upgrading their digital inventory rather than their real-life homes. But one thing seems sure: as the housing market continues to be inaccessible for young people, homeownership will become an ever more distant fantasy – perhaps one increasingly enacted on digital devices.McGill is optimistic that the world of virtual decorating will continue to grow. He thinks in the future Design Home will be more than just a distracting game, but a means of blurring the already indistinct lines between fantasy and reality, as well as game playing and marketing.“Design Home will continue to transform the interior design and gaming industries by connecting retailers and consumers in an empowering and innovative gaming playground, giving players deeper visibility into an array of home decor, including boutique brands with no retail presence,” he says. “Design Home brings a positive light to people’s lives, allowing them to relax, be creative and learn and then put the game away and apply those learnings to their real-life decorating skills. In light of the current situation, people are looking for this creative outlet more than ever.”";REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;My streaming gem: why you should watch The World Is Yours;"Netflix was supposed to be the great democratizer. The streaming platform’s most ardent fans have argued in its favor as a level playing field, instantaneously providing a global audience of millions to smaller independent films that would otherwise never reach them. Critics of the service’s business model have posited that dropping little-known films into such a vast library with little-to-no marketing or promotion would damn those titles to an obscurity even more severe. Just one of the cases in point for the latter school of thought: The World Is Yours by Romain Gavras, a sly crime comedy that Netflix acquired for the US after a positive premiere at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, then allowed to languish for six months before unceremoniously dumping it into the unending sea of content (it’s available on Amazon Prime in the UK). The release hardly made a blip that December, and in the year-and-change since, its reputation hasn’t grown much.I've never seen … The Shining Read moreIt’s a grave injustice that should be easily remedied, seeing as Gavras follows in a popular tradition of roundly, generously enjoyable gangster mischief. There’s a little Scorsese and a little Ritchie in his fleet-footed stylizing, which whisks audiences through a caper and its attendant double-crosses with a roving, restless camera. Gavras comes from the world of music videos (he directed the nine-minute clip for M.I.A.’s Born Free, in which riot troopers carry out a genocide against redheads), and applies many of the same techniques to long-form narrative. But where many talents making that creative migration in the past have hidden behind slow-mo, format changes and other slickness – “like a music video” still gets the occasional workout as a stock critical diss – Gavras folds it all into a story with the substance to justify its sumptuous flash.Kind and merciful, Farès (Karim Leklou, his round face perfectly non-threatening) doesn’t belong in the criminal demimonde, and he knows it. He’s finally set up the job that he hopes will provide him with enough seed money to go legit as the chief provider of ice pops to the Maghreb region of north Africa, and to reject the life of ruthlessness foisted on him by his ice-cold mother (Isabelle Adjani). She’s just one of the unstable quantities trifling with Farès’s plan, an ensemble including an Illuminati conspiracy-monger, a rage-prone Scotsman, his eight-year-old daughter and a pair of trigger-happy idiots with Tony Montana fantasies that lend the film its title. You know at least part of the drill; no one can be trusted, things go wrong and yet there’s something unexpected and satisfying about who gets to clinch their happy ending, and how.A spiky political subtext also sneaks up on a viewer while they’re busy chuckling at the gallows humor. (The aforementioned morons get the bleakest laugh when one imagines killing their boss and retiring in luxury together, then the other immediately envisions the same scenario frame by frame, except he also shoots his partner and keeps the loot for himself.) Much of Farès’s scheme hinges on the xenophobia against Muslims and African immigrants currently festering in France and Spain. The climactic heist plays something like a well-told joke, its punchline being that the gang-averse Spanish police can be readily manipulated into action with even the faintest whiff of terrorist activity.In another world, this would be something of an event on the international cinema circuit, between its high-wattage cast (Adjani and co-star Vincent Cassel rank as two of the bigger names in France’s industry) and Gavras’s instinct for crowd-pleasing. He does everything bombastically; he likes musical interludes, whether that’s a karaoke rendition of Toto’s Africa or clutch soundtracking from the of-the-moment electronic virtuoso Jamie xx. His major set pieces – a boatjacking that ends in flame, a bomb scare at a water park – have a zest and ambition absent from many film-makers of his relative greenness. It’s just the sort of hidden treasure an adventurous watcher would’ve once picked up at a video store, or wandered into at an arthouse theater. It’s much harder to stumble upon in the endless scroll of the streaming format; until a better system devises itself, we’ll have to pick up the slack of spreading the word.";REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;Canada mourns Takaya – the lone sea wolf whose spirit captured the world;"When Doug Paton burst from his trailer on a warm spring afternoon, he expected to confront yet another stray dog agitating the livestock on his sister’s farm outside Victoria, a city on Canada’s west coast. Instead, standing barefoot in the grass, he found himself face to face with a wolf.“It stopped dead in its tracks and it stared me down,” he says. Then, as quickly as it appeared, the wolf trotted away, pausing once to stare back at Paton before clearing a five-foot metal gate and vanishing.“Just like a person, you might not remember a name, but you never forget a face,” he says. “I’ll never forget that face as long as I live. I just close my eyes and see it.”Facebook Twitter Pinterest Doug Paton got a Lone Wolf tattoo to mark his encounter with Takaya. Photograph: Leyland CeccoAfter leaving a breathless Paton back in 2012, the young wolf traversed nearly 25 miles of urban sprawl, taking shelter in the backyards and parks of British Columbia’s capital, until he reached the south-east tip of Vancouver Island. From there, the wolf swam nearly two miles towards a scattering of tiny islands within sight of the city.In the eight years that followed, the wolf – named Takaya (the Lekwungen word for wolf) by the Songhees, a local First Nation whose territory encompasses the islands – quickly became a legendary figure, drawing fans from around the world captivated by stories of the resilience – and tenderness – of the young predator.But his life ended in tragedy on Tuesday, in a series of events that laid bare both the cold uncertainties of life in the wild and the limits of an often-strained bond between humans and wild animals.Tayaka was a rare species of canine known as the coastal or sea wolf. These predators thrive in marine environments and have become adept at living off a diet of salmon, shellfish and seals instead of deer. Fifty years ago, there were few coastal wolves in the region, victims of overhunting and habitat degradation. Today an estimated 250 of them roam the 12,000 sq miles of Vancouver Island, a remarkable turnaround for the embattled predators.Two years after Paton’s experience, Cheryl Alexander got her first glimpse of Takaya, in May 2014. Like many of the 370,000 residents of greater Victoria, the environmental consultant and photographer was curious about how the wolf could survive among the wind-battered trees of the tiny islands.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Takaya swam two miles to a scattering of tiny islands. Photograph: Cheryl Alexander/Wild Awake ImagesShe saw Takaya emerge from the ocean briefly and slip into the trees. The piercing howls that followed were a chilling and powerful experience. “It had emotions associated with it that were very melodic,” she says. “Everyone was almost moved to tears.”Much of the excitement surrounding Takaya came from the unlikeliness of his journey. Few wolves have ever traversed the heart of Victoria, and the islands Takaya took up residence on were tiny, 10 times smaller than the narrowest known range for a wolf pack in the wild.Most notably, he arrived alone. Wolves almost always live in nuclear families; two parents and their pups. Occasionally, one will break away to form a new group. But the dangers of hunting – the sharp antlers and stomping hoofs of panicking animals – are often fatal for a lone predator. That Takaya travelled solo – and seemed content to remain alone – added to the myth and excitement.In recent years, new housing developments have marched steadily outwards from Victoria, swapping land that was once forested and wild for cul-de-sacs and two-car garages.But the chain of islands close to the city is a rare enclave of untamed nature. Pine and fir, punctuated by the rich amber hues of arbutus trees, create thick inland forests. Seals haul themselves on to the shores and small mammals – mink and otter – scurry among the rocks.Takaya quickly got to work, feasting on the seals and otters and sharpening his ability to catch fast-moving fish. But with no permanent streams on the island, he also had to use his ingenuity to survive. Drizzly winters created temporary wetlands, but summers in the region are dry. In a move that astounded biologists, he began digging wells on the island.“He really pushed the envelope of what’s possible ecologically, both in terms of how he made his living, and the small amount of space that he actually required to do so,” says Chris Darimont, a wolf expert at the University of Victoria and the Raincoast Conservation Foundation. Takaya was an “extreme data point” on the spectrum of anything researchers had previously encountered.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Takaya was known to dig wells to find drinking water in the dry summers. Photograph: Cheryl Alexander/Wild Awake ImagesPeople began paddling out to the islands, hoping to catch a glimpse of this miraculous wolf thriving in the ever-vanishing wild around them.But as his popularity grew, fed by a steady flow of stories in the local media, government authorities feared a dangerous encounter with humans had become inevitable and in the summer of 2012 and winter of 2013, conservation officers set up a series of traps. But Takaya seemed untrappable, ignoring the bait laid out for him.Plans to capture Takaya put the province at odds with the Songhees First Nations, who vigorously protested the idea of removing the wolf. Long a symbol of the Lekwungen people, there was an excitement among the community that a wolf had finally returned.Resistance to capturing the wolf also unearthed longstanding grievances over control of the islands. Known as Ti’ches in Lekwungen, the archipelago has long been a source of natural medicines found in the woods and fish in the surrounding waters. When the colonial government enacted a ban on traditional indigenous ceremonies in the 1800s, the Songhees would travel to Ti’ches to practise in secret.Archival photographs show large wooden structures along the shore, all of which have long disappeared; dismantled, destroyed or stolen over the years. Today the Songhees own all of Chatham Islands and share a portion of Discovery Island with the province of British Columbia. But even the name of the area – Oak Bay Islands Ecological Reserve – remains a vestige of colonialism.“There’s a huge piece of culture that’s not known or appreciated,” says Mark Salter, the former tourism manager for the Songhees Nation, who has worked to educate the public about the history of the islands. On numerous occasions, he has had to put out fires left by campers and pick up garbage left on the shore. “People invite themselves out here, not knowing this is reserve land. But they’re not welcome.”In 2016, a group ignored a ban on bringing pets to the islands, travelling with their two dogs. As they walked through the forest, they soon realised they had acquired a third canine in their group. The group panicked and scrambled on to the roof of a nearby lighthouse building, where they called coastguard rescue. Armed conservation officers also arrived, prepared to deliver a fatal shot if needed. Takaya was spared, but the encounter chilled Salter, who worried the wolf’s fame, which only increased over time, could be his undoing.Howls still echoing in her mind, Alexander began boating around the islands, eager to repeat her first encounter. This time she came prepared with telephoto lenses. Her early sightings of Takaya were rare and infrequent. He was ghostlike, quickly vanishing from view.“There was something very captivating about him,” she says. “For whatever reason, I felt a really intense connection. I just wanted to learn about his life.” She returned to the islands week after week. With permission from the Songhees Nation, Alexander was able to set foot in the forests where Takaya often hid. Walking gingerly among the pine and fir, she could sense his presence, even as he remained camouflaged among the trees and tall grass.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photographer Cheryl Alexander, centre, with biologists Thomas Riemchen and Sheila Douglas. Photograph: Leyland CeccoHe began appearing – and vanishing – more frequently. In their hundreds of encounters – including one in which he sat just three feet from her – Alexander felt drawn to his tenderness. “Wolves want what we want,” she says. “They play. They touch. They care deeply about other members of their family.” It was these human-like characteristics that moved people the most. His lonely howls could often be heard from the city during calm weather. Wolves, like humans, crave companionship in some form. As Takaya aged, outliving most wild wolves, he did so alone.No wolf had ever been recorded living alone for so long, says Darimont. And lone wolves typically avoid howling, so as not to draw the attention of nearby packs. Nearly everything about Takaya, it seemed, was exceptional.In 2019, a documentary featuring Takaya that Alexander helped produce aired in Canada and on the BBC, further cementing his fame.Then, in February 2019, a lone female was spotted on the rocky shores of the mainland, across from where Takaya made his swim. Experts doubt she swam the channel – but her presence ignited hope that Takaya might soon be reunited with one of his own.“There was something about his aloneness … his alienation from his own kind … that spoke to people’s own feelings of alienation and aloneness in the world,” says Alexander. “Plus, we’re all hopeless romantics.”Facebook Twitter Pinterest Takaya’s howls could be heard in the city on calm days. Photograph: Cheryl Alexander/Wild Awake ImagesOthers found strength in the wolf’s solitude. Paton, whose spring encounter in 2012 was likely the first recorded sighting of Takaya, was locked in a bitter custody battle and divorce when the two crossed paths.“I didn’t want to fight any more. And then I saw this lone wolf and thought, ‘If he’s healthy – if he’s doing fine by himself, then so can I,’” he says. “From that day forward, I just changed my attitude towards things. I stopped feeling sorry for myself. I felt more invigorated than ever to get things right in my life. And I never looked back.”Soon after, Paton had the words “Lone Wolf” tattooed on his forearms in permanent tribute.With all the success Takaya had enjoyed on the islands, no one is sure why, on 25 January this year, he dipped his 10-year-old body into the swirling emerald waters one last time and swam towards the city.Emerging from the ocean on the opposite shore, he was greeted by a scene of parks and forest, interrupted by condominiums and family homes. Darimont believes the most likely reason, despite the popular conception of Takaya as a lonely figure, was that he was overcome by the annual hormonal urge to mate, which occurs in January.“I suspect he gave up tranquil retirement on the islands to go find a mate,” he says. Conservation officers have their own theories. They believe a string of intense storms in the winter months, which had blown fierce winds across the islands, might have disrupted Takaya’s access to food. The greenery of city parks across the water and the potential of a new source of food might have been enough to lure a hungry wolf.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Takaya was spotted in Beacon Hill park, a sprawling green space in downtown Victoria. Photograph: Leyland CeccoAlexander, however, rejects mating and food loss as likely explanations for Takaya’s journey. In the days leading up to his departure, trail camera images showed a healthy, robust wolf. And if the previous nine years of hormones hadn’t been enough to move him from the island in search of a mate, she wondered why – at nearly 11 years old – he suddenly felt the urge to leave. Instead, she feared he might have misjudged the swift ocean currents and been swept towards the mainland. Or that the sound of poachers on the island – hunting ducks in the winter – might have prompted the skittish wolf to seek refuge in the water.“I doubt that he was intending to leave permanently. I just can’t see it. It was his territory. It was really the only thing he knew. He’d been there all of his life,” she says.For nearly 48 hours, Takaya, briskly trotting through parks and along sidewalks, led police on a wild chase through the city.The city remained transfixed as police posted the wolf’s progress on social media. Alexander remembers a night riddled with anxiety as she received constant updates on the chase. Eventually police tracked Takaya to a house, finding him wedged between a garage and a fence. Alexander pleaded with officials to let her see Takaya, but was held back. “I was nearby and I believe that he could smell me,” she s ays.Takaya was sedated and carried upside down, his tongue hanging from the side of his mouth, and placed into a metal barrel.After snapping photos of his limp body being carried away, Alexander returned home to celebrate her husband’s birthday and then went to bed. “The next morning, I just woke up, and cried,” she says.Two days later Takaya was released back into the wild, emerging from the stupor of drugs on a gravel logging road. Conservation officers decided to relocate him more than 100 miles from the islands. He was moved inland, where the forest is thick and impenetrable, along the rugged west coast of Vancouver Island.Away from the familiarity and comforts of his small islands, Takaya faced a daunting list of new threats. Packs of wolves in the area might kill him if their paths crossed. Leg-hold traps, laden with bait, might prove too tempting to a starving wolf. Even the new prey – elk and deer – were unfamiliar. “There was tons of stuff that he hadn’t had to deal with in his life,” says Alexander. “I was very worried.”Facebook Twitter Pinterest Takaya on Vancouver Island. Photograph: Cheryl Alexander/Wild Awake Images“Nature is nature and you can’t predict what’s going to happen,” said conservation officer Mark Kissinger, who tranquillised Takaya and set him free, at the time. “But hopefully things go well for him.”Each time she visited the islands in the weeks that followed, Alexander was struck by an overwhelming sense of emptiness. “There’s an absence now of energy. There’s an absence of possibility,” she said, steering her boat through a narrow channel one sunny February afternoon.“He gave us a portal into the wild and into nature – and into something that we often don’t get to see. And if we do, it’s only just a glimpse.”Then, at the end of February, Alexander received an email from a woman who had spotted a wolf while out walking near the fishing community of Port Renfrew. It had peered at her from the forest and showed no signs of aggression when her dog approached it.Alexander travelled to meet the woman but returned home without any sightings. Then, that night, she was sent a photograph from a man who had a series of trail cameras in the area. Alexander took one look at the picture, and recognised Takaya. A bright yellow tag was pinned in his ear – a souvenir from his experience with conservation officers.Alexander travelled back to Port Renfrew, this time bringing her own trail camera. Checking it a few days later, the video showed Takaya walking past. The sighting, so close to a populated area, immediately concerned Alexander.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Takaya’s adventures ended when he was shot by hunters. Photograph: Cheryl Alexander/Wild Awake Images“He doesn’t have that fear instilled in him that humans are bad. He’s trusting. It worries me he may find himself in a situation where humans are not all good and don’t have his interests at heart. It really scares me; it worries me,” said Alexander following the sightings.Her instincts proved right.On 24 March, Takaya was shot and killed, nearly 30 miles from where he was released. In the weeks before his death he had been spotted with increasing frequency, raising fears an encounter might prove fatal.On his final day he came too close to a hunter’s dogs. In the end, it was his curiosity, built up from years of protection offered by the islands, that was his undoing.British Columbia’s Conservation Officer Service told Canada’s CTV news: “We understand many British Columbians and people around the world shared care and concern for the wellbeing of this wolf and this update will affect many people.”None more so than Alexander, who said simply: “It’s heartbreaking.”";REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;Waxahatchee: Saint Cloud review – the best album of the year so far;"(Merge Records) With tracks that nestle in heartache and bask in hard-won wisdom, this is an artefact of American song that measures up to Dylan at his peakAccording to the title of her previous album, Alabama songwriter Katie Crutchfield was Out in the Storm, playing breakup songs with a hulking rhythm section. On the follow-up, she sounds like she’s out the other side of it, more or less.With the wind dropped and the air cleared, Crutchfield has turned away from indie-rock entirely to embrace the Americana and country-rock of her native region, and in so doing has made the best album of the year so far. Aided by unfussy, clean but never sterile production by Brad Cook – and perhaps the sobriety she has recently embraced – the haze has lifted and her songwriting can really be seen.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Waxahatchee: Saint Cloud album art workWhat songs these are, genuinely good enough to be compared with peak Dylan: like him, Crutchfield is adept at nestling into the almost comforting niche of heartache and hopping out again with a grin (“Marlee’s in the back just trying to maintain her wind on the weathervane” is just one very Dylanesque line, too). On the infectious mid-tempo hoedown Can’t Do Much, she’s happily hopeless, “honey on a spoon”, and on The Eye there’s more joyously wild new love: “You watch me like I’m a jet stream.”But the album is full of hard-won wisdom, some of it self-lacerating, set to backings that are variously stoic and bruised. The peak on this high plateau of American song is Ruby Falls, a frank, poetic valediction to a former lover about how things just don’t work out sometimes. You can almost feel her hand in theirs; once again, she clears the air to reveal something beautiful and true.";REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;Could the New England Patriots do the unthinkable and tank?;Radical times call for radical measures. Could the New England Patriots seriously be considering tanking? If you ask Fox Sports’ Colin Cowherd, it’s not only possible but likely. “I think what they’re going to do is like Miami did last year,” Cowherd said on his radio show recently. “Create a culture, or in New England’s case, maintain it. Not be very good at quarterback … playing to win, but losing. And knowing you’re going to lose.” Yes, it sounds ridiculous at first, but there’s the possibility that Cowherd could be right . Let’s break things down.Who exactly will be the next Patriots quarterback?Well, that’s the key question now, isn’t it? As you may have heard, Tom Brady left the organization after 20 years to sign with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Patriots have yet to pursue a clear cut replacement – such as Andy Dalton, Cam Newton or Jameis Winston – instead they signed Brian Hoyer, a career backup who has had two prior stints with the team. Hoyer will likely be competing with Jarrett Stidham unless the Pats pull off a surprise move. Stidham, by the way, has made four passes in his entire NFL career.When was the last time that the Patriots held a quarterback competition?This ownership has never really seen one. When Robert Kraft bought the team back in 1994 they had already found their quarterback in Drew Bledsoe. When Bledsoe was injured in 2001, Brady took over and never looked back. The only blip on the radar was in 2008 when Brady suffered a season-ending injury in the season opener and Matt Cassel came in to replace him. That was also, it should be noted, the last time that the Patriots missed the playoffs, and even then just barely as they put up a 11-5 record.Is Brady the only significant departure?Hardly. The Patriots had one of the best defenses in the league last season, but they have lost two key linebackers in the offseason. Jamie Collins signed a three-year deal with the Detroit Lions and Kyle Van Noy signed a four-year deal with the Miami Dolphins. And while he wasn’t on the level of Brady, the Patriots also parted ways with 14-year veteran placekicker Stephen Gostkowski, which left special teamer Matthew Slater as the longest-tenured Patriot.Last year, the Patriots were good enough to go 12-4 in the regular season, mostly thanks to that tremendous defense. It ended up not mattering as they were upset by the Tennessee Titans during wildcard weekend. Now, the Patriots are without one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time and their defense has taken a significant step back.Yeah, but they still play in the AFC East right?While it’s true that there have been few things more reliable in the NFL than the Patriots taking advantage of a weak division in order to sneak into the playoffs, that may no longer be the case. The Buffalo Bills certainly proved that they weren’t to be ignored last season by going 10-6 and earning one of the AFC’s wildcard spots. With Brady gone, they have every reason to believe that that they should be considered favorites. The New York Jets underachieved last season, but they were only a game below .500 and the Dolphins somehow managed to win five games despite the fact that they stripped the franchise down to spare parts. The division looks to be competitive from here on out, so if the Patriots were going to tank this would be the time to do it.What would be in it for the Patriots?Well, one of the few negative byproducts of the Patriots’ long-term success has been the fact that they have mostly been picking late in the first round of the NFL fraft. This would be their chance to potentially make a bold move for a star player. Cowherd points to Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence as being the type of player of the future who they would actively target, and one who almost certainly would be well off the draft board in 2021 unless the Patriots secure a high pick.What makes you skeptical about the Patriots tanking?Let’s start off with the fact that head coach Bill Belichick is about to turn 68 and is far closer to the end of his career than the beginning. It’s hard to imagine he wants to be part of a long-term rebuilding project if there was a way to avoid it.Keep in mind that there’s ego involved here. Belichick would love to win without Brady. There’s a case to be made that his best year as a head coach was that 2008 season where he nearly made the postseason with Matt Cassel as his quarterback. While Cassel had more offensive weapons than Stidham will have this upcoming season, Belichick may be curious to see if he could have similar success.And that’s before you take into account that tanking isn’r easy. Many players want to impress so they can secure a better contract or a trade to another team. Many thought the Dolphins were built to lose last year, and they ended up being competitive(ish).So what are the Patriots going to do?They may not even know yet. The Patriots have been quiet so far this offseason and that may be because they don’t know if they should make a move to get better or not. It doesn’t help that they aren’t in a great position salary cap-wise. They have $26m worth of dead money on the books, meaning they’re paying players who won’t actually suit up for them, with $13.5m of that going towards Brady.This doesn’t necessarily mean that the Patriots will be sellers when the NFL season resumes. The most likely scenario could be that Belichick sits back and sees what he has with Stidham and the rest of his roster. Maybe Belichick will once again make stars of a few no-name players, or maybe the whole thing is a disaster and they actually end up semi-intentionally tanking anyway. It would be a bit surreal to see the Patriots tearing the whole thing down, but all empires crumble eventually, don’t they?;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;The Strokes on their wilderness years: 'There was conflict and fear and we got through it';"Having failed to match the success of their 2001 debut, New York’s coolest band had petered out. How did they come back with a brilliant new record – and designs for electric bikes?Julian Casablancas and Albert Hammond Jr are sitting at opposite ends of an overstuffed sofa in an upmarket London hotel, some weeks before the coronavirus crisis reached the UK. They look, as the Strokes have always looked, like rock stars of an exceptionally cool variety: cool enough, certainly, to pull off what look suspiciously like mullet haircuts. Hammond’s is a little longer at the back than most people would countenance, while Casablancas has gone for the full-on shaved-at-the-sides, strands-of-hair-curling-around-the-shoulders look.Other than the hair, they look almost eerily unchanged from the way they did almost 20 years ago, when the Strokes emerged from the indie clubs of Lower East Side in Manhattan and blazed a brief, dramatically successful trail through Britain, singlehandedly upending the UK’s post-Britpop alt-rock doldrums, precipitating a burst of musical activity that would give the world the Libertines, the White Stripes, the Killers, Kings of Leon, Franz Ferdinand, Interpol, Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Arctic Monkeys. “I just wanted to be one of the Strokes,” sang the latter’s frontman, Alex Turner, on their 2018 album Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino.Speaking as someone who looks nothing like they did 20 years ago, the ravages of time having very much taken their toll, it is hard not to regard Hammond in particular – who, at nearly 40, is trim and exceptionally handsome in a tight-fitting pair of tailored trousers, a shirt buttoned up to the neck and a pair of Dr Martens brogues – and wonder at the absolute bloody unfairness of it. After all, one of us spent a significant proportion of the intervening years in a state of terrifying dissolution – alternately injecting himself with cocktails of ketamine and cocaine and heroin and cocaine, by his own admission coming “close to death” – and it was not me.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Backstage at the Fillmore, San Francisco, in October 2001. Photograph: Anthony Pidgeon/RedfernsThose days of dissolution are a long way behind them. Hammond finally cleaned up after an intervention in 2009; a few years before, Casablancas had conquered the alcoholism that left him, in his former manager’s words, “a drunken nightmare to society as a whole” and made interviewing him the kind of event that journalists discussed among themselves in hushed, horrified tones. If you want to know how bad an interview with Casablancas could get, read the US writer Neil Strauss’s collection Everyone Loves You When You’re Dead, in which the singer somehow contrives to emerge as by far the most wayward and difficult figure in a book that also features Jerry Lee Lewis, Ike Turner, Mötley Crüe and sundry unnamed members of the Calabrian mafia.In fact, these seem to be rather good times for the Strokes, whose fortunes since the release of their multiplatinum 2001 debut Is This It have been mixed. They say they struggled to take in their initial success: never as famous in the US as they were elsewhere – “When we got home, it was still all about Christina Aguilera or whatever,” says Hammond – they don’t seem to have fully grasped how big they were. “It was like, we’re going to do Reading festival and we don’t even really know what a festival is. And then you’re getting moved to a bigger stage and we didn’t know what that meant either: ‘I don’t even give a shit! Who is Reading anyway?’” He says he didn’t even know what the NME was. “Not to say I took it for granted – it was exciting. But it was happening in England, we were signed to a small label
, it didn’t feel real.”September 11 happened fewer than two months after Is This It came out and “kind of distracted everything”, Hammond says. “Success was just like this weird, vague, slow thing. Our second album, it was like: ‘If we don’t put something out quick enough, then this’ll be over.’ Then our second album didn’t do as good as the first and the third album didn’t do as good as the second, so there was never a feeling of: we fucking made it! Roll credits! It was always this kind of half-anxious, half-exciting ‘What the hell is happening?’”Facebook Twitter Pinterest Performing at a rally for Bernie Sanders in February. Photograph: Andrew Harnik/APStill, it was better than what happened next, which Casablancas describes – with what turns out to be characteristic delicacy– as “some grey areas on control and on quality, fuelled with the traditional, less exciting and more cliched elements of a rock band’s success – grossness”.“Those cliches,” nods Hammond. “So funny.”“But true, though,” says Casablancas, quietly.There were also, by all accounts, terrible intra-band conflicts, perhaps exacerbated by the fact that Casablancas had written the Strokes’ first three albums almost in their entirety (the other band members got one co-writing credit each). “I think wanting to be in charge and wanting something to be good are different things,” he frowns. “One is about selfishness, the other is about something objective. Is this person just an egomaniac wanting control or is it someone who can actually make it better? And that’s just life.”A low point was reached with 2011’s Angles, a laboured album that sounded as if it was made by a band who did not want to record it at all, which, reading between the lines of what Casablancas says, is not that far from the truth. They declined to tour or promote the release of its successor, Comedown Machine, at all, “because we weren’t in harmony”, he says.Politics has been the same thing since Nixon, with people getting less aware and less caring Julian Casablancas“You know, maybe in a few years it really won’t matter and I’ll just say it … I could explain it, it’s not a big deal, but …” He tails off, but concedes that they felt the “need to not be contractually bound” to a band that was now “limiting to our personal lives. I guess it’s not that controversial, really. There was conflict and there was fear and we got through it and we made records, but it wasn’t, you know, out of pure brotherly love and musical inspiration.”Like a lot of people, I had assumed they had split up after a 2016 EP, Future Present Past, quietly slipped out on Casablancas’s own label
, Cult. By then, Casablancas was given to comparing the Strokes unfavourably to his work with the Voidz, a weirder and more eclectic outfit; Hammond seemed content releasing solo albums; the guitarist Nick Valensi was busying himself with a heavy metal-ish project called CRX; the bassist, Nikolai Fraiture, formed Summer Moon with the drummer from Jane’s Addiction; and the drummer, Fabrizio Moretti, was working on visual art. But here they are, promoting the release of a sixth album, The New Abnormal, produced by Rick Rubin, no less: “I guess he thought: these guys have fallen far enough,” smiles Casablancas.It is the best thing they have done in years, a subtle, smart updating of their original melding of the Velvet Underground, various New York new wave bands, the Cars and Tom Petty, with noticeably more politicised lyrics than previous Strokes albums, unless you count their views on New York City cops. “I’ve always been interested in politics,” says Casablancas, “but I can trace the moment I was like: ‘I have to read books and see what’s happening,’ to the second George W Bush victory: ‘What, we re-elected this dude?’ That was so baffling to me that I went deep into politics. It’s been the same thing since Nixon, with people getting less aware and less caring.”Facebook Twitter Pinterest On stage at the Roundhouse, London, in February. Photograph: Michal Augustini/Rex/ShutterstockThe state of the US aside, the making of The New Abnormal has apparently left its authors in a hugely positive state, creating “the possibility of something even better later”, says Hammond. “What we could do next excites me more than I have been excited in, I don’t know, our whole career.”Their reputation has also been burnished by the passing of time. Lizzie Goldman’s 2017 book Meet Me in the Bathroom was ostensibly about “Rebirth and Rock and Roll in New York City 2001-2011”, but it hinged on the story of the Strokes, turning them into a mythic entity. Critically acclaimed, it is about to be turned into a film.The Strokes’ recent benefit gig at a Bernie Sanders rally was riotously successful: audience members climbed on stage, then the police walked on to try to clear them off, which led to the improbable sight of Julian Casablancas singing New York City Cops – “they ain’t too smart” – while an actual New York City cop stood next to him, attempting to attract his attention.A couple of days before I meet Casablancas and Hammond, the band play a one-off London show: it is sold out, the queue to get in already snaking down the street hours before they are due to play. On stage, they look in remarkably high spirits, eschewing a performance of their debut single, The Modern Age, in favour of making up a song in the middle of their set. “Julian likes to jam,” sighs Hammond, “so he goes up to the guy in the band that does it least and tells me to do it. Kind of like Spinal Tap, where they do their free-jazz odyssey.”Nevertheless, there are moments when the atmosphere during our interview feels a little strained. Nothing like in the old days, when Casablancas was wont to unexpectedly leap on journalists and kiss them or tell them to fuck off and walk out, but there is no mistaking the slightly agonising way he picks his words, as if he is worried about upsetting someone. A routine inquiry about Rubin’s fabled calm, Buddha-like presence in the studio leads to a deathly silence, punctuated by a series of sighs, and eventually the words: “It’s Rick Rubin, so … I don’t want to like, you know …” before his voice trails off entirely. “Interviews are interesting,” he finally decides, “because it’s not about honesty, really.”Facebook Twitter Pinterest Watch the video for Bad Decisions, from the new album, The New Abnormal.What do you mean? Are you concerned about being misrepresented? “Sure, that’s part of it. On a selfish, personal level, interviews are the opposite of therapy. It’s like unhealthy self-reflection. And it’s just years of people in your life being: ‘I was really upset about what I read in that thing,’ and I’m just like: what?! It’s very easy to get stuff out of context when it becomes the quote.”And then he brightens, proclaiming the Guardian “really cool” and me “super-nice”. He talks about the band members’ non-musical activities: Hammond has dabbled in fashion, while Casablancas, more surprisingly, has designed a folding, pedal-free electric bike, a most un-Strokes-like form of transport about which he is nevertheless enthused. “Electric bikes seem like the future of communal travel to me.” He looks at Hammond. “He rides motorcycles and I think that’s cool, but the truth is that everyone falls off and hurts themselves. If you ride an electric bike and fall off, it’s like running fast; it’s how our bodies are designed.“I just thought it was interesting making something,” he continues. “It’s expensive and time-consuming and the business world is fascinating, because you see the mechanisms of the decision-making process that has led to art, quality and truth being circumvented for, you know, financial ease and sheep-like following of trends.“Even with putting out a record, you know, since the day the Strokes got signed, it was this wrestling match between doing cool creative things and smart marketing things. It’s a dance, and I respect the dance, but that’s why right now pop music is king over art and quality, because it’s all been scientifically worked out. That’s why cars are ugly, because if someone makes a cool car, they’ll make slightly less money. ‘But think of all the inspiration you’ll cause in the world!’ ‘No, you’re fired!’”Then he stops talking and exhales. “Anyway,” he says.The New Abnormal is released on 10 April on Cult and RCA Records";REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

70;Why do rightwing populist leaders oppose experts? | Jan-Werner Müller;"It is conventional wisdom that populists are against “elites” – and experts in particular. But rightwing populists aren’t opposed to all elites – they only denounce professionals who claim authority on the basis of special knowledge. Their perverse version of rightwing anti-authoritarianism implies that there is nothing wrong with the wealthy; in fact, the latter can be superior sources of wisdom. Trump putting the advice of “business leaders” above that of infectious disease experts is likely to yield deadly results. But it’s important to understand that the systematic denigration of professionalism started not with the populists – Reagan, Thatcher and other cheerleaders for neoliberalism led the way.Under coronavirus, ideologies are overturned around the world. But it is too little, too late | Jeff Sparrow Read morePopulists are often criticized for being great simplifiers, when the world is in fact highly complex. For those who take Trump to be the paradigmatic populist of our day, it’s easy to conclude that populists are constantly lying and ushering in a “post-truth” era, in which falsehoods exclusively produced by the daily White House reality TV show are literally turning out to be deadly.But this picture is itself simplistic. Populists are not by definition liars. They are only committed to one particular empirical falsehood: the notion that they, and only they, represent what populists often call “the real people” – with the implication that other politicians are not only corrupt and “crooked”, but traitors to the people, or, as Trump has often put it, “Un-American”.More important, it’s not true that today’s rightwing populists are indiscriminately against all elites. They only denounce professionals. Trump supporters did not find it scandalous that his cabinet was full of Wall Street figures. The base does not resent the rich – rather, it aspires to be rich. In their eyes, the wealthy have earned their money, an objective indicator of their “hard work”, or the fact that they really produced something (never mind that the likes of Ross and Mnuchin have never created anything and only shifted money around).These supposed movers and shakers contrast starkly with professionals who claim authority on the basis of education and special licensing – think lawyers, doctors and professors. Such figures can automatically be maligned by rightwing culture warriors as “condescending” – after all, they tell other people what to do, because they claim to know better. According to Nigel Farage, for instance, the World Health Organization is just another club of “clever people” who want to “bully us”.Is the success of the Trumps, Bolsonaros and Johnsons of this world proof that the people can always be seduced by demagogues – and simply don’t know what’s good for them? Distrust of professionalism does not come out of nowhere. Neoliberalism paved the way for these attitudes. Margaret Thatcher memorably held that academics didn’t really do any work; in fact, they all – with the possible exception of scientists – seemed to be lefties wasting taxpayers’ money. Tories introduced the imperative constantly to audit and assess (and discipline and punish those not measuring up); only what could be counted, counted. Governments that praised “free markets” – the spontaneous emergence of economic order – actually ended up constructing entirely artificial “markets” in academia and healthcare. These pseudo-markets had to provide the right “incentives” – because, so the assumption went, professionals could not possibly be motivated by intrinsic goals of helping patients or pursuing research or educating young people.This concerted attack on professionalism made it easier for Trump and Boris Johnson to claim that they might just know better than leading scientistsThe result was not a genuine market, but a vast bureaucracy reminiscent of the late Soviet Union. What one historian has called “the tyranny of metrics” meant that the measure became the target; the relentless quantification of performance distorted what and how professionals performed. Enormous resources, and a fair bit of cunning, went into gaming a system which was based on the suspicion that professional self-regulation and internal accountability are sham ideals that just justify professionals erecting monopolies and closed shops.This concerted attack on professionalism made it easier for Trump and Boris Johnson to claim that they might just know better than leading scientists. Business leaders are praised as more capable decision-makers, when it comes to the length of a lockdown, than epidemiologists. Trump – who apparently listens to theories cooked up by his uniquely unqualified son-in-law and fears being upstaged by Anthony Fauci – has still not understood that the longer amateur hour at the very top lasts, the more lives will be lost.The Covid-19 crisis might lead us to a clear-eyed view of the value of professionalism (including professionals in politics like, say, Hillary Clinton). But it’s also important to keep professionalism in its place. Professional advice should constrain political choices, not determine them. Proper professionals, unlike technocrats, do not promise that they know the uniquely correct solution to all policy problems.The assumption that there is only one right way is perversely shared by populists and technocrats: populists claim that there is only one authentic popular will (to build a Wall, get Brexit done, or what have you), and that they are the only ones who know it – and the only ones who can implement it. The technocratic stance – widely on display on the continent during the European debt crisis – holds that there is only one rational answer to policy challenges, and that only technocrats can identify it. If you disagree with a populist, you are declared a traitor to the people; if you disagree with a technocrat, you’ll be told politely that you’re not smart enough.The lesson is not that professionalism should replace democratic politics, or, for that matter, widespread participation by citizens – a conclusion drawn by unashamedly elitist liberals who have sought to reinstate professional gatekeepers everywhere, but especially in primaries. Citizens still know best what their problems are; professionals – in perfectly non-condescending ways – play a crucial role in addressing them. Or, as John Dewey, the greatest American philosopher of democracy in the 20th century, put it, “no government by experts in which the masses do not have the chance to inform the experts as to their needs can be anything but an oligarchy managed in the interests of the few.”";REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;Anger over Prince Charles's Covid-19 test is a warning sign of divisions to come | Gaby Hinsliff;"We are all still in this together. But some of us are now falling so much deeper into it than others.We simply don't know what kind of Britain will awake from all this | Martin Kettle Read moreWhat finally made me cry this week was a picture shared by a Canadian doctor, of four little girls waving through a window. This is the only way she will see her two daughters until it’s over, she wrote. She has sent them to stay with their cousins, to protect them from any infection she could unwittingly bring home from treating the sick and the dying.In Britain too, some medical staff are making the agonising decision to live apart from pregnant partners, while teachers caring for key workers’ children shove work clothes in the wash at the end of the day and try not to think about what could be lingering on them. Yet still key workers can’t get tested – even when they start showing symptoms – to confirm whether they pose a risk, either to those they help or to their own families. For now, precious laboratory time is reserved for those sick enough to come into hospital.No wonder some were furious, then, when it emerged that Prince Charles had been tested despite suffering from what’s said to be only a mild case of coronavirus. Buckingham Palace insists it was done for sound clinical reasons, and even if it wasn’t, one princely test makes no practical difference to the ability of hundreds of thousands of key workers to get one.But this spasm of public anger is a warning sign, nonetheless. It suggests we’re moving into a dangerous new stage of this epidemic, one where heartwarming stories of hope and altruism – small children pogoing manically to Joe Wicks’ free live-streamed PE lessons every morning, almost half a million people volunteering overnight to run errands for the vulnerable – may give way to something darker.Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall – who left London for the Balmoral estate only hours before the government instructed everyone else not to flee to the country, for fear of spreading infection or overloading rural health services – aren’t alone in hightailing it out of town. While the super-rich seek to ride out the epidemic in hastily rented moated mansions, or on deserted tropical islands, the weekending middle classes have quietly decamped to second homes in Devon or Norfolk or Cumbria.Houses that normally sit shuttered and forlorn until Easter started opening up again the minute the schools shut – and so many people have been trying to book hideaway cottages on remote Scottish islands that ferry crossings are being restricted. Tiny communities with no cases of their own are understandably afraid of what wealthy urban refugees may bring with them, and fear curdles all too easily into resentment.But the age-old divide between town and country isn’t the only one at risk of widening. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, today moved a long way to bridging an emerging gap between the conventionally employed (whose salaries will be part-guaranteed by the state if their jobs are frozen) and the anxiously self-employed, who are now promised a similarly generous lifeline. The latter may have to wait until early June for the money, with the universal credit system buckling under the strain of new claims, however, and isn’t for the highest earners; meanwhile, Sunak hinted the quid pro quo could be reform of tax perks for the self-employed after we emerge from this crisis.The safety net knitted last week at breakneck speed, meanwhile, is already starting to fray at the edges. Renters worry that their three-month reprieve from eviction might not be as watertight as it looked; older people, told they can stay in and simply order food online, are being left with little choice but to venture out when supermarket delivery slots are booked solid for weeks.So far, this virus is mainly exposing divisions that we already knew existed. We hardly needed a virus to tell us that the royals are privileged, work is precarious for many, and some families have resources others don’t – whether that’s a cottage by the sea, a back garden to play in, or the skills to teach their own children. Kids whose parents are now raiding the internet for kitchen science experiments will lose less ground academically over this long summer than those whose parents struggle with basic maths themselves – widening attainment gaps that were stubborn enough before.But as time goes on, this virus may create unexpected new divides too. We desperately need mass antibody testing, said to be only weeks away, to establish who has already had the virus and might now be immune, on top of the existing tests showing who has it now. Reliable testing would let key workers go back to the frontline – or in some cases back home – and others return to the kind of non-essential jobs that keep an economy ticking over.But testing could also turn us overnight into a society of had-its and haven’t-yets: the former free to roam the outside world again; and the latter still stuck indoors, worrying about their jobs. We can overcome this divide, like any divide, given far-sighted political leadership and individual generosity, but only if we see it coming.It may seem churlish to dwell on what divides us rather than what we are discovering we have in common. But the lesson of an epidemic that has seen doctors raiding DIY stores for protective masks, and children separated from their mothers by cold hard glass, is that it pays to be one step ahead, not running to catch up; that where we are now is not necessarily where we will be tomorrow. A crisis that has so far brought us together may soon, if we’re not careful, begin to push us apart.• Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist";REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;They can lock me down, but they can't make me read Proust | Suzanne Moore;Well – it’s all going well so far, this “staying in for ever” thing. My anxiety flares up at different times and mostly takes the form of intense irritation at particular groups of people. But I don’t mind being angry, as that is the thing that stops me being depressed. So far I have managed to have a row with the foolish hippies in the local health food shop about the stupid sign in the window about the only doctors you need being Dr Happy and Dr Nutrition and some other new-age nonsense. I merely pointed out that we might need, you know … some actual doctors.Special venom has been reserved for joggers ( I note they now all call themselves runners) who pound every public place full of mucus, assuming they have right of way, and never seeming to observe the two-metre rule. Stay in. Do star jumps.Coronavirus is the first crisis Johnson has faced that can't be played for laughs | Rafael Behr Read moreThen there are the public figures whom it is now finally permissible to hate, from Kirstie Allsopp, currently writing a diary of self-absorption, to Prince Charles, who managed to get tested, even though the BBC reported that his symptoms had been ‘“mild” – and this at a time when most frontline workers have not had tests – to the usual roll-call of businessmen who turn out to be selfish monsters. Whoever coulda known?But my biggest bugbear at the moment is the well-meaning advice trotted out all the time by people who clearly have no real understanding of how life is for most people. I comprehend that there are many decent folk trying to help people with their mental health. All of this advice can be summed up in one word: structure. None of it does anything for me as it also weirdly assumes some superannuated Protestant work ethic that is clearly no longer applicable.What is this getting up early and sitting at your desk fully dressed nonsense? Anyone who has had a truly shite job knows that pretending to look busy when there is nothing to do is harder work than any actual work.Also, all those analysts who predict the future have already been telling us that tech will take at least 40% of our jobs away anyway. So we have to make lives where working less is part of them.So here is the chance: do nothing. Do whatever gets you through the night as the death toll rises.Women cannot be at home half-working and home schooling. This is ridiculous. I am sorry if my suggestion that most work and most school is utterly meaningless sends you into an existential crisis, but we are in one anyway.Watch the news or don’t watch the news. Its hard to avoid the presence of basically giant morgues being built. Maybe this is why all these exhortations to go on some self-improvement kick sit so uneasily with me.We are already being told what to do by the government, and we know we have to do it. Now this other layer of “experts” appear to tell us how to exercise, have educational fun and games with the children and bond with the family. Have any of these folk been cooped up with kids and their own family? It’s a bloody nightmare.Yes, now apparently is the time to learn a new language. Sure, I did Mandarin last week. Or there is calligraphy, as Stephen Fry suggested. Or you can clean. Whoopee! Or rearrange your book cases. Who are these people? I have never arranged my bookcase in my life, or got up early to sit at a desk. Why, as the world collapses, am I meant to do this now?If I want to stay up all night watching strange German movies it’s up to me. If I want to be a slattern again, it’s my choice.I never managed Proust in pre-virus days, so don’t saddle me with him now, for God’s sake. Let me be, and you rush around doing whatever it is that makes you feel better. The obsession with “productivity” is odd. Except if you are a frontline worker. Then I bow down to you, I really do.Someone check in on Madonna, please – from her Instagram she appears to be locked in a bathroom. And a big-up to Britney, who is now some kind of Bolshevik. But please, no more chin-up cheerleading.The only useful advice I have had was from someone I did mushrooms with in Amsterdam. Don’t @ me, it’s legal there. He gave me a stick-man drawing that said: “This is Bill. Bill wants to take a trip but Bill doesn’t want to contract corona. Bill chooses to take a trip at home. With mushrooms.

73;The unemployment rate doesn't go back to normal after a recession – there are long term effects | Ken Henry;You might think that the consequences of recessions are short-lived. The unemployment rate goes up for a short time, but subsequent strong growth quickly gets things back to normal. Not true.The lessons of past recessions tell a different story.The immediate economic case for minimising the loss of jobs in a recession is obvious: as workers lose jobs, their incomes fall, they consume less, and other businesses also shed workers. Without government action to boost demand, a vicious cycle is established.But there is also a longer-term consequence. In past recessions, many who lost their jobs were never able to find another, even years later.In the recession of the early 1980s the unemployment rate almost doubled, increasing from 5.5% to 10.5% in two years. The number of unemployed Australians increased by 330,000. An equivalent proportion of today’s workforce would be about 650,000. It took six and a half years, to the end of the 1980s, for the unemployment rate to claw its way back to somewhere close to where it started.When it comes to unemployment in Australia, definitions have been broken | Greg Jericho Read moreAnd there were other, deeper, consequences. During the recession of the early 1980s, the proportion of Australian males with a job fell by about 7%. In the subsequent recovery only half of that fall was reversed. And then Australian workers were hit with the recession of the early 1990s. Over the next three years, the proportion of males with a job fell by a further 10%.By the time of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in mid-September 2008 the Australian economy had enjoyed an extraordinary 16-year expansion. Yet after all those years of growth, the proportion of Australian males with a job was only a little above where it was at the low point of the early 1980s recession. Think about that for a moment.That’s what a small group of policy advisers and ministers in the Rudd government were thinking about as we gathered together on the morning of Saturday 11 October 2008 in the cabinet room in Canberra to discuss an appropriate response to the emerging global financial crisis.The prime minister, Kevin Rudd, the deputy prime minister, Julia Gillard, and the finance minister, Lindsay Tanner, were joined by the treasurer, Wayne Swan, calling in from Washington. All of us were aware that many of the male workers who had lost their jobs in the early 1980s recession had never worked another day in their lives. For those workers, losing attachment to work in the recession became permanent.The social cost was terribly high. We couldn’t let this happen again.During the GFC, the proportion of Australian males with a job fell only a little, from 69.8% to a low of 67.8%. By the start of 2011, it stood at 69.4%.Outcomes for females were better. In September 2008 55.8% of females had a job. That proportion never fell below 55.2% during the global financial crisis.But there were still consequences. Over the year to July 2009, those females who kept their jobs worked, on average, 45 minutes a week less. And males who kept their jobs worked 1 hour 25 minutes a week less. Average hours of work fell by 3.5%. The reduction in hours of work during the GFC constituted a large proportion of the total labour market adjustment. Many people worked fewer hours, but they retained their jobs.In the period since mid-2009, average hours worked by females have remained at that lower mid-GFC level. But average hours worked by Australian males have fallen by a further 2%.Newly unemployed Australians queue at Centrelink offices as MyGov website crashes again Read moreThe trend to fewer hours of work has not been entirely voluntary. The underemployment rate, which measures those in the workforce who have a job but would like to work more hours, is about 8.5%, having been less than 6% before the GFC.Recessions have long-term consequences for people who lose their jobs. We should not assume that the loss of a job is only temporary. Rather than being made unemployed, it is preferable that hours of work are reduced. But many people working casual hours today will suffer severe financial hardship if they have to work fewer hours. That is why there is a case for government-provided income support.For both economic and social reasons we must keep as many people as possible in jobs, working fewer hours if necessary, and we must supplement incomes with temporary payments from government.;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
74;Can the Houseparty app help us stay sane in quarantine? I downloaded it to find out | Sanjna N Singh;Last week, my friends and I were squeezed into a booth at Heyn’s, an ice cream shop in Iowa City. While the coronavirus was on everyone’s mind – we were liberally spritzing from my home-made bottle of hand sanitizer - hardcore social distancing had not descended upon the town yet.As we ate our cups of butter brickle, I felt Aimee stiffen by my side. She pointed her chin at the door, her face a mask of distress. I followed her gaze to see a little boy wholeheartedly licking the doorknob. We watched in horrified fascination.“This is what happens,” Aimee sighed, “When you spare the rod.”That was our last “in real life” night together. After we elbowed our way out the door and hugged goodbye, the University of Iowa moved classes online and we tucked ourselves, reluctantly, into our respective homes.“Who’s up for a virtual happy hour?” Marisa texted the group a few days later.“In!” we said, thoroughly sick of our own company. After a lot of back and forth about platforms, I suggested we download Houseparty.Houseparty had gotten a lot of attention among the under-24 set when it first started back in 2016. Its CEO, Sima Sistani, touted it as the “next best thing to hanging out in real life”. It had been installed by 35 million users (40% of whom were outside the US.) In subsequent years, however, downloads of the app had declined – that is, until the pandemic. Downloads in March 2020 were the highest of the year. Twitter confirmed Houseparty’s re-emergence into public consciousness: “Everyone is back on Houseparty. It’s 2017 again.” “Make Houseparty great again!” “Who’s down to get Houseparty again and get this social distancing lit?”Ready to get literally anything lit, I persuaded everyone to download the app and meet up in an hour. I brought out the wine, sent my new username out and waited. Slowly people started popping up on my phone screen. We broke into smiles and all started speaking at once. The audio immediately became a garbled mess.“Dammit!” I shouted. “Y’all broke Houseparty!”The audio did smooth out shortly after, but kept dropping intermittently, probably due to my slow internet. This might have been a blessing, as I believe I missed a whole section about how Ian didn’t use soap in the shower.What we are really finding out from this coronavirus is what everyone’s news source is“Just a vigorous blast on the pits” is all I heard.“Vox said this is gonna last 18 months,” Jeremy said.“What we are really finding out from this coronavirus is what everyone’s news source is,” Aimee said. “Mine is y’all.”Jeremy tapped a pair of dice on top of the screen, that launched a trivia game. We all tapped fast and furious on answers to questions like: what was the name of Cady’s high school in Mean Girls (Answer: North Shore.) There was a lot of yelling and laughter and then the game ended. I started thinking about dinner.“I ordered a pizza last night,” I said. “We drove to the pizza place but they didn’t let us in. They asked us to roll down the window and threw the pizza at us.”We laughed and for a brief moment it felt like we were all at the Dandy Lion again, joking over cheeseburgers. Shortly after, we signed off. It was dinnertime, tacos had to be made, soylent consumed.Seeing my friends via Houseparty didn’t feel normal – not by a long shot – but it did seem to lift, somewhat, the isolation I was feeling. That glass (or two) of wine felt much better when it was shared, even if just on a screen. My friends agreed. (Well, all except the one who doesn’t use soap.) The games were too easy, he thought.“You try being a competitive virtual playground in the age of corona,” Jeremy joked.Games notwithstanding, faced with an indefinite period of social distancing, I’m pretty sure we’ll all jump back on to Houseparty in a day or so. If nothing else, it’ll give me a reason to brush my hair.;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
75;The Russian Dolls have transformed figure skating. But at what cost?;"Facade has always been central to figure skating. The sport’s culture dictates that athletes should smile through pain and errors. In the ‘kiss and cry’ area - where skaters wait for their scores – there are rarely dramatic displays. Even when a performance is unfairly marked by the judges, skaters will blow kisses to the camera and wave to the crowd. However peeved they may be, they’ll never reveal it, preferring instead to suffer in silence. Burying true feelings just goes with the territory.“It’s a vicious cycle when you live inside the bubble,” says Kiira Korpi, a two-time Olympian for Finland who is now a psychology student at the New School in Manhattan and a children’s rights activist. “You don’t even realise how unhealthy or toxic some of the cultural norms are.”Last week should have seen the world championships take place in Montreal, but the Covid-19 pandemic put paid to that. Unintentionally, it may have shifted the landscape of women’s figure skating in the process.Barring a minor miracle, three Russian teenagers would have battled it out for the podium places: 16-year-old Alena Kostornaia and a pair of 15-year-olds, Anna Shcherbakova and Alexandra Trusova. The trio have revolutionized figure skating. They only made their senior debuts last year but blitzed through the sport, ensuring a multitude of headlines. In the Grand Prix final last December, Kostornaia claimed gold while Shcherbakova and Trusova rounded out the medals. They repeated the trick at the European championships the following month; their opponents left dumbstruck by their dominance.What makes them so good? Well, owing to their remarkable jumps, they maximize the technical points on offer. Trusova and Shcherbakova have both mastered skating’s holy grail: the quad, an exhaustive element – and up until recently an unheard-of feat for ladies, which is four full rotations in the air.However, there are concerns. First, rather than a skating competition for women, are we now dealing with a jumping competition for girls? Second, and much more importantly, what’s the cost of success – physically, emotionally and psychologically – for this collection of raw, developing children?Figure skating, John Coughlin and the disturbing reality of athlete-on-athlete abuse Read more“The worst aspect to this is that most of the time, in skating and gymnastics and maybe other sports, you grow up in a culture that’s very authoritarian,” Korpi says. “You grow up to believe if you get injured it’s because you’re weak. Or if your body or psychological state fails it’s because you are weak. But why does the body of a teenager break?“Obviously, the athlete has responsibility but we never really question if there’s something wrong with the coaching. Has there been a lot of over-training? I hear from doctors about 12-year-olds in America, Finland and Sweden – and I’m sure in Russia it starts even earlier – coming to clinics with stress fractures and things which shouldn’t happen at that age. It points to the fact the training has been too much. And how do they deal with that when they’re so young?”All three Russian teenagers boast the same coach: Eteri Tutberidze, who has built a stable of female talent. She is a divisive figure, though not much is known about her – unusual for a skating community that can border on the incestuous. She made her name as a coach in 2014 when a 15-year-old girl in a red dress named Yulia Lipnitskaya cast a spell in Sochi and was crucial to Russia winning gold in the team event. She became a star. The following month, she finished second at the world championships but was quickly discarded as her body began to develop. By the end of 2016, she was done with the sport altogether. Drained and disillusioned, the following year she revealed a long-running battle with anorexia. “I’m no longer drawn to the ice,” she said, damningly.By that stage, Tutberidze had moved on and guided another prodigy, Evgenia Medvedeva, to back-to-back European and world titles. But at the 2018 Olympics, Medvedeva was pipped to first place by her training mate, 15-year-old Alina Zagitova, three years her junior. Tutberidze had a new favorite and within months, Medvedeva made a startling and unprecedented move. She left Russia altogether, deciding to continue her skating career in Canada. “I feel more adult here,” Medvedeva said later in 2018.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Evgenia Medvedeva reacts with coach Eteri Tutberidze after she was pipped for gold in the women’s free skate at the Pyeongchang Olympics. Photograph: Maddie Meyer/Getty ImagesAnd then there’s Zagitova, the reigning Olympic and world champion. Still just 17, she announced in December that she was taking a break from skating for an indefinite period. The previous month, she had admitted finding it difficult to keep up with younger competitors, who she still trained alongside in Moscow. Most worryingly of all, she described how even attempting a quad jump was unrealistic for her until she got slimmer.“Quads are too dangerous for me for the time being,” she said. “I will need to prepare for them physically and mentally. I will also need to lose some weight, something like 3kg, to decrease the risk of injuries.”And this is a cornerstone of the debate surrounding the jumping phenomenon in women’s skating and the rise of the so-called Russian Dolls: the female body.Puberty can vastly change how a skater performs. They grow taller, and heavier. It’s expected. Most critically of all, it’s natural. But in some skating quarters it’s seen as an unwanted development and detrimental to skills such as the quad jump. Physical changes mean tweaking of techniques. And sometimes, coaches don’t have the interest or patience. They’ll merely find a younger skater to shape instead. Somebody who is prepubescent and weighs less. So, it’s a genuine possibility that skaters on the edge of adolescence are buying into a fear and suspicion of puberty. And in a society where body image and the messaging surrounding it is such a hot topic, it seems skating has aligned itself with a deeply unsettling pattern.“It’s dangerous,” Korpi says. “I was never educated on the effects of not getting your period. The expectation was that it was a good thing. Nobody was talking about the symptoms it can create, the psychological problems, the stress fractures that can happen due to the fact you don’t get enough energy and your hormonal function not working. So we need to call out the community for sending these unhealthy messages. This notion you should always restrict your food and always lose weight and no matter what you must restrict, restrict. That kind of messaging is so concerning.“I know many athletes who are emotionally and physically broken because the system doesn’t care how much goes to waste as long as there are a few who make it. But what’s worrying is that those who make it are only there for a few years and then they’re broken too: they’re ‘too old’ or can’t sustain their careers.”Korpi has a particular academic interest in the abuse of children and sees such behaviour as commonplace within skating circles.“There can be serious emotional abuse in training and coaching,” Korpi says. “Maybe skating is specifically vulnerable to child abuse because of the way the sport has developed and the way we value those crazy jumps and how it’s easier to do them when you don’t have an adult body yet. So the more robotic you can treat your mind and body the better. The coach is the one that holds the key to success. But if their coaching is emotionally abusive it can have very drastic consequences and has been compared a lot to the abuse between children and parents.”Some say it’s an overreaction. That skating has always produced exceptional, young talent. And it’s worth mentioning that coaches such as Tutberidze are working within the ISU’s age-limit rules. Ultimately, her job is to develop champions and she would certainly argue that everything else – regardless of the moral implications – is not a coach’s concern.“Skating has had child stars – Tara Lipinski, Michelle Kwan, Sarah Hughes – but they weren’t pushed out of the sport because they couldn’t keep up with the technical demands,” Korpi says.Because of the postponed world championships, the trio of Russian teenagers may not compete again competitively until the end of the year. By that stage, their bodies may have changed dramatically and Tutberidze may have moved on to her next project.“I don’t think Eteri’s child factory is the biggest problem in skating,” Korpi says. “The problem is the sick culture that’s been created. Eteri’s factory is a symptom of this inhumane direction and culture our sport is taking. She’s not the cause. There are many other coaches who work in a similar manner to her and many federations that support this kind of coaching.”So, it seems like skating has a decision to make: keep the facade in place or start to ask itself some tough questions.“For many people, it’s not interesting anymore,” says Korpi. “People miss watching emotionally mature women skate instead of girls. It’s almost – and I feel this too – difficult to watch some of these very, very young child stars. Because you can’t help and think of what’s behind that kind of performance and success.”";REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;UFC champion Jon Jones arrested on firearm charge after police hear gunshot;UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones has been arrested on suspicion of driving while under the influence and negligent use of a firearm after officers heard a gunshot and found him in a parked car with a handgun and a half-empty bottle of liquor early on Thursday, Albuquerque police said.The 32-year-old Jones also faces charges of possession of an open container of alcohol and no proof of insurance for a vehicle, police said.Jones was found in the driver’s seat of a parked vehicle with the engine running just before 1am on Thursday morning, according to police. Authorities said Jones showed signs of intoxication and a handgun and a half-empty bottle of liquor were in the vehicle.“As part of the investigation into this incident, our Gun Violence Reduction Unit will test the firearm and bullet casing to determine whether the gun has been used in any crimes,” an Albuquerque police spokesperson said. “Reducing gun violence in Albuquerque is our top priority.”Jones is considered one of the best UFC fighters of his era. He has a 26-1 record and retained his title in February by beating Dominick Reyes by unanimous decision. He was stripped of his world title in 2015 after a hit-and-run incident.;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
77;Anna Kournikova provided blueprint for success not guide for glamorous failure | Tumaini Carayol;"“You lost here today, sum up your day at Wimbledon,” asked a stuttering voice from behind the BBC camera. A few hours earlier, Anna Kournikova had fallen in the first round of Wimbledon in 2002. She was ranked 55, her career plunging into a spiral as the media lapped up her losses. What followed was a painful, infamous interview. As Kournikova rolled her eyes and laughed away the leading questions, the reporter became so flustered in her presence that he asked her to do his job: “What would you think was a good starting question?”Tennis players sign petition calling for financial help during coronavirus crisis Read moreFew tennis players have ever replicated the frenzy that constantly surrounded Kournikova. Her arrival in the sport was soundtracked by the screams of hysterical fanboys. As she became the world’s highest-paid female athlete, her most lucrative endorsement was a sports bra deal. The infamous tagline said: “Only the balls should bounce.”Back when women in sport received even less respect than today, the discourse around Kournikova was excruciating. She was described as a “teen sexpot” at 16 before the writer noted that he “appear[ed] to be flirting” with her. By 18 she was harrowingly dubbed the “Jezebel of Sweat”. The Sun once promised to publish “a photo of Anna every day”. Meanwhile it seemed every last Kournikova article was mandated to use the world “flirt”.Kournikova could be snotty, rude, and a nightmare for WTA staff but she perfected the art of stirring the pot; by her 18th birthday she had been linked with the Russian hockey stars Pavel Bure, then aged 28, and Sergei Fedorov, aged 30. When informed in Sports Illustrated that some disapproved of the age of her suitors, she doubled down: “Every country I visit, I have a different boyfriend,” she said. “And I kiss them all.”This month marks exactly 20 years since Kournikova broke into the world’s top 10, yet people primarily associate her playing career with the gloom reflected in that Wimbledon interview and remember her as a terrible player known only for her glamour. Her name is offered as a cautionary tale and her career has slowly morphed into one of the great sporting punchlines. She may have earned all of that money, they say, but she sure couldn’t buy herself a title.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Anna Kournikova with Martina Hingis in 1999. Photograph: David Gray/ReutersThe focus on Kournikova’s title count is unhelpful. She was a solid athlete with a crisp all-court game who excelled from modest beginnings in Moscow. She beat Steffi Graf, Martina Hingis and Lindsay Davenport, reached a Wimbledon semi-final in 1997 at 16, and became doubles No 1 in 1999. Kournikova’s popularity may have been rooted in her blond hair and her looks, but she still enjoyed a career that most tennis players dream of.In the years since, Kournikova has influenced much more than just her own career and her rise inspired greater feats. In 2004, a year after Kournikova’s final match, a trio of Russian women – Anastasia Myskina, Maria Sharapova and Svetlana Kuznetsova – won Russia’s first three slam titles consecutively. Since then, women’s tennis has thrived across former Soviet nations.The two greatest Russian players feel her influence deeply. Sharapova spent her youth renouncing the unending comparisons with Kournikova, but Kournikova was still the blueprint. Sharapova followed her lead from Russia to the Bollettieri Academy in Florida, she frequently wore Kournikova’s hand-me-downs, and built a similar portfolio of endorsements: “I knew I needed to get past Kournikova,” Sharapova wrote in her autobiography. “When I did that, I’d be judged on my own terms.”When asked to name the most influential Russian tennis players, Kuznetsova was clear. “Anna Kournikova is No 1 for sure,” she told WTA Insider. “For me, she brought really big popularity to Russian tennis, women’s tennis. Everyone after her was just after her. For me, she was a big, huge push … Everybody was saying she never won a tournament, hee hee ha ha. I’m like: ‘OK, have you been to the top 10? Have you ever held a racket?’”Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.In the mid-90s, women’s tennis was in such a rut that Martina Navratilova called the tour “Steffi and the Seven Dwarfs”. In one heave, Venus Williams, Serena Williams, Martina Hingis and Kournikova exploded on to the tour like supernovas and changed the game for good with their combined swagger, marketability and mutual resentment. Women’s tennis has always been an outlier among women’s sports, the one willing to cynically (and successfully) use glamour and sexuality to advance its brand. The way Kournikova marketed herself, attracted attention and was surrounded by agents helped to shape the game as it became increasingly more professional in the 2010s.In the end, Kournikova’s flame burned brightly and swiftly. By 2003, aged only 22, she injured her back and she was done. The question that always accompanied Kournikova was what would happen when she grew older and the cameras had found someone else to permanently train their lenses on.Perhaps her greatest achievement, then, is what she didn’t become. Instead of desperately attempting to consolidate her fame in retirement or struggling to adjust in the absence of an adoring crowd, she simply departed on her own route. After commanding the most public-facing career tennis has seen, she lives the most private life today. She recently gave birth to a third child. She seems to be happy. We will probably never know.";REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;Tour de France could be staged this summer without any spectators;"Professional cycling reacted with a mix of cautious optimism and scepticism after the French sports minister, Roxana Mărăcineau, confirmed that together with the Tour de France organisers ASO, her officials were exploring ways of running a scaled down Tour with restrictions on spectator access this summer even though the country is currently in lockdown to limit the spread of the Covid-19 virus.With the Olympic Games and Euro 2020 already cancelled, the Tour is one of very few major events remaining – for the time being – on this summer’s sporting calendar. Reports on Thursday suggested that a deadline of 1 May seems likely for a decision on the Tour, because it will be clear by then whether the outbreak has peaked in France, and because that would give a clear two months for cyclists to prepare for the race. A representative of ASO contacted by the Guardian said the company had no comment to make.In brief: Girl, Woman, Other; Damascus; Colombia Es Pasion – review Read more“There needs to be a Tour de France. After that, it is the state of public health which will determine how viable that is,” said the Groupama-FDJ manager, Marc Madiot. Madiot’s team leader Thibaut Pinot, whose parents are both involved in the fight against the virus, told the website cyclingnews.com that, “the question is not whether the Tour de France can take place at any cost or not. My concern lies mainly in the fact that if we cancel the Tour de France, it would mean that the pandemic has not stopped.”From Belgium, Patrick Lefevere, the head of the sport’s most successful team, Deceuninck-Quickstep, was dismissive, saying: “I’m an optimist, but I don’t see how they can justify running the Tour de France. What about the fans? Who can enter France and who can’t? Are we really going to stuff the hotels with people? I can’t imagine someone waving a magic wand in early July and the coronavirus crisis suddenly being resolved.”“As long as public health can be guaranteed,” the head of the Sunweb team, Iwan Spekenbrink, told the Le Monde newspaper, “I can see this being the race that restarts the cycling season, even if it will have to be guaranteed that everyone has a minimum amount of time to train for it.”Facebook Twitter Pinterest The peloton ride the Champs-Elysees at the end of the 2019 Tour. Photograph: Gonzalo Fuentes/ReutersASO and the French sports ministry worked together to ensure that the first major stage race of the year, Paris-Nice, went ahead in early March in an atmosphere of tension as European nations began to close their borders and impose lockdowns as the crisis deepened. Spectators were not permitted at the race starts and finishes, or on major climbs, and the daily ritual of riders signing on was abandoned.Certain teams decided not to start, and others withdraw during the race amidst concerns for the health of their riders and staff, and on the logistics of getting riders and staff back to their homes. The race ended a day early to avoid a finish in the centre of Nice.Mărăcineau told a French radio station on Wednesday that the Tour might be feasible in a restricted form because it does not rely on ticket sales but on television rights for the bulk of its income. “Everything is imaginable,” she said. “Everyone knows the reasons and the benefits that it can bring to all. So finally it wouldn’t be so bad because you could still watch it on TV.”She added that she was well aware that the Tour was the principal showcase for cycling team sponsors, and that the survival of professional cycling itself might be at stake. “Cancelling the Tour would be a real problem, even if it was for only a year. But for the moment it’s too early to take a decision.”Marching on together: Bielsa and Leeds show team spirit as wait goes on Read moreAs the biggest ticketless sports event in the world, the Tour draws between 10 and 12 million spectators to its roadsides during the season, prompting obvious questions about the practicality of running the race “behind closed doors”, although many of those spectators come from outside France and might be deterred by closed borders. But at least the 2020 Tour itself does not cross any of those frontiers, as it takes place entirely within France after its start on 27 June in Nice.The Tour calls upon 29,000 members of French security forces during its 22 days, with at least one gendarme on every road junction along the route and access restrictions have at times been imposed on some major climbs to avoid overcrowding. Recently, amidst fears of terrorism, security measures at the event have been massively increased.If the Tour were to go ahead, it would not be the first time that the French state has ensured this. In 1968, immediately after the country had been through a period of public disorder and protest, the Tour organiers were considering cancelling the race but were told by the government that they wanted it to go ahead to underline that normal life was still going on.";REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
79;Spring-heeled: concept that could see Usain Bolt rocket to 50mph;Prototype of revolutionary running device being worked on by scientists at US universityA wearable spring-based contraption that attaches to the legs has the potential to boost human running speeds by 50%, according to researchers who hope to build the first prototype over the next year.Scientists came up with the concept after computer models showed that it was possible to dramatically increase the amount of energy people put into each running step by enabling them to do work when their feet are in the air.The device, which leads to what the researchers concede is an “unconventional means of running”, could set the stage for a new Olympic sport, they believe, and be adopted by police forces and emergency rescue teams. According to the scientists’ calculations, if Usain Bolt mastered the contraption, his top speed would rocket from 27.8mph to nearly 50mph.“We wanted to see what physics allows and then explore it further by developing a device,” said David Braun, an engineer who works on human augmentation at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.“This shows us how far we can push the boundaries and what key features we should focus on to develop the new technology.”Braun hit on the idea after studying the mechanics of running and cycling. While the fastest human running speed on the flat is close to 28mph, the equivalent top cycling speed is nearer 50mph. Much of the difference is due to bicycles being in contact with the ground the whole time and the pedalling mechanism which allows the rider to power along constantly.“When you look at world-record running, the foot is on the ground only 20% of the time, so for 80% of the time it is in the air and not providing any energy for motion,” Braun said.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Illustration: Amanda Sutrisno and David J. Braun/Vanderbilt UniversityWhat is needed, he reports in Science Advances, is a way for runners to do work when their feet are off the ground.Braun and his colleagues used computer models to test a number of theoretical devices that took into account air resistance, the power limit of the human leg and the energy that is lost when the foot impacts the ground. They concluded that a spring-powered device that attached to the legs could give runners the boost they sought.The principle behind the device is to store energy by compressing a spring when the runner lifts and bends their trailing leg before they swing it forwards. When the leg moves forward, the spring is locked and remains compressed until the foot hits the ground. Only then is the energy released to power the runner forwards.“This allows runners to do work during the aerial phase of the running motion,” Braun said. “It’s the key to borrowing the benefits of cycling and using them in running.”Technology in 2050: will it save humanity – or destroy us? Read moreA second requirement is for the springs to be “programmable” so that the stiffness can be increased as the runner picks up speed. This can be done with a mechanism that steadily shortens how much of the spring can be compressed, since shorter springs are stiffer than longer ones.The effect, Braun said, is comparable to the gears on a bike that are switched up as the cyclist rides faster.Just as ice-skating and cycling take time to grasp, so might the final contraption take some mastering, the researchers admit.And while Braun hopes to have a demonstration model finished in a year, it may take several more years of development to reach its full potential.“At the early stage, it will look like an exoskeleton, but in the later stages we hope it will look like a shoe,” he said. “It’s one thing to build a prototype but quite another to miniaturise it.”;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;Chess: Candidates stopped at midway point after Russia suspends air traffic;France’s Maxime Vachier-Lagrave led after seven of the planned 14 rounds, as global body Fide plans a later resumption with points already scored still countingThe world championship Candidates in Ekaterinburg was abruptly stopped on Thursday morning, with seven of 14 rounds played, after the Russian government announced international air traffic would be suspended from Friday. Fide, the global chess body, planned a charter flight to Amsterdam enabling the Chinese, Dutch, French, and US grandmasters plus their aides and tournament officials to leave before the deadline.Fide’s intention is to complete the tournament later this year, still in Russia and with points already scored counting, so that its winner, the official challenger for Magnus Carlsen’s crown, can play the Norwegian in Dubai in December. Whether coronavirus will permit this schedule remains to be seen.Chess: Candidates defy coronavirus to start battle to face Magnus Carlsen Read moreThe Candidates had been the only global sporting event to continue under the threat of the virus. The eight GMs had daily medical checks, and the games were played behind closed doors. They could still be watched online and with no competition from other sports chess sites reported a surge in viewers.Seven of the 14 rounds have been completed and these scores will stand when it becomes possible to resume the postponed tournament. Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (France) and Ian Nepomniachtchi (Russia) led with 4.5/7, ahead of Fabiano Caruana (US), Anish Giri (Netherlands), Alexander Grischuk (Russia) and Wang Hao (China) all 3.5/7, Kirill Alekseenko (Russia) and Ding Liren (China) 2.5/7.Vachier-Lagrave was a late substitute after Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan withdrew, but the Frenchman played well and scored a significant win over Nepomniachtchi in the seventh round,especially as head-to-head is the first criterion in a tie-break situation.The Winawer French 1 e4 e6 2 d4 d5 3 Nc3 Bb4 is rare nowadays in top-class tournaments, but Vachier-Lagrave was ready for it as his opponent had used it earlier in the tournament and might be tempted to use the French Defence against a Frenchman.Seventy years ago the French was the staple weapon for Mikhail Botvinnik in his title matches against Vassily Smyslov,and the patriarch also used it against lesser lights, even against myself at Hastings 1961-62. Most present-day grandmasters distrust the French as too passive, and reasons for this emerged in the game.

Scott Murray talked us through Chelsea’s 1970 FA Cup final replay win against Leeds on Saturday – here’s the action from Old Trafford. Or to cut to the chase, it was all about the tasty, er, challenges. Next up, we revisited that Euro 96 semi-final – here are highlights of it not coming home. And if you really want to wallow in the mythology of that summer, here’s the full ITV documentary looking back on it all.2) In a happy alternative universe, England’s cricketers would be taking on Sri Lanka in the second Test this week in Colombo, which was the venue when England won the tightest and most combative series these sides have contested, in 2001, with Graham Thorpe steering England to a nervy four-wicket victory to wrap up the series 2-1. And here’s the last time Moeen Ali looked truly on top of his game for England, skittling Sri Lanka in tandem with Jack Leach to seal a series whitewash in Colombo in 2018. And while we’re on the subject of Sri Lanka, shall we have a bit of Murali?3) A young keeper keeps himself busy during self-isolation. And a less accomplished piece of amateur penalty-taking. At the same time, the pros are keeping themselves very busy. Manchester United’s Angel Gomes goes for the bin, Trent Alexander-Arnold hits a garden ornament that looks like a cement mixer, James Milner has entertained the masses and Ben Chilwell is coming up with fun ways of making tea.4) This week marks four years since the death of Johan Cruyff. Not only was he a genius on the pitch but also a fine manager. Whether it is talking tactics, dribbling around opponents or banging in the goals, Cruyff was absolutely box office. Ultimately, he was an original artist on the football pitch, too.5) For those feeling a touch more energetic during these quiet times, you can always run a marathon on your balcony. There are still plenty of options, including kicking toilet rolls and parkour.6) The first virtual Formula One grand prix took place this week, due to the lack of actual racing. Lando Norris was involved, alongside Liam Payne and others of a similar ilk.

83;Uncorked review – sub-par Netflix wine drama is far from vintage;Solid performances aren’t enough to lift this familiar tale of a Memphis man trying to break out from his family business out from the middle of the roadIn Uncorked, an undemanding new Netflix drama, a young man finds himself trapped between his desire to be a sommelier and his father’s wish to have him take over the family barbecue business. It’s a battle between the old and the new and a similar war rages on behind the camera as Insecure writer-producer Prentice Penny, here making his directorial debut, goes through familiar motions while also trying to bring something fresh to a tried-and-tested formula, a challenge he’s not quite up to, the result falling somewhere in the middle … of the road.The Platform review – fiendish Netflix thriller about a gory battle for food Read moreMamoudou Athie, best known for small roles in The Front Runner, The Get Down and Sorry for Your Loss, graduates here to his first lead as Elijah, a man working two jobs in Memphis: serving at his family’s popular BBQ joint and selling at a local wine store. His father (Courtney B Vance) intends for him to take over the business but Elijah’s growing interest in wine has given him other ideas and with the cautious support of his mother (Niecy Nash), he embarks on a quest to become a master sommelier, even if it means problems at home.Uncorked is indicative of the sort of film that Netflix now overflows with: adequate, mid-tempo product that’s hard to hate but even harder to love, a background watch that only sometimes threatens to break through to the foreground. There’s clear talent involved, from Penny who, over at HBO, helped Issa Rae to carve out one of the smartest and funniest comedies of recent years, to hardened, can-take-anything-on character actors like Vance and Nash, but there’s not enough special sauce here to make it linger, it’s a palate cleanser at best.It’s the age-old tale of the child who doesn’t want to inherit the family business because he has a passion of his own and with these two competing worlds being food and drink, one would expect at the very least to salivate at what’s placed on screen. But despite Penny stuffing his script with terminology, he struggles to make either side truly come alive. The film is in need of both a stronger motivating force and a cannier visual technique that might help us understand and appreciate Elijah’s immersion in wine culture. We see copious glasses of it but we’re never lured into reaching for one of our own at a time when we’re not in short supply of reasons to drink. There’s an aesthetic missing and given the territory, it’s a film that desperately needs one.So much of the film doesn’t feel fleshed out enough, most notably a thin romantic subplot with a character who only exists to ask Elijah questions that advance the narrative. There’s a bit more depth back at home with Elijah’s family but a great deal of that is the result of Vance and Nash, who do a lot with very little, both able to force their vaguely etched characters to life with precious little help from Penny. Nash in particular is so vibrant that one wishes the film was centred around her instead and she tries hard to add poignancy to her arc, delivering perhaps the film’s most human moments. Athie is a likable lead but Elijah is such an underwritten enigma that it becomes hard for him to corral us into caring about his journey, one that’s never quite as involving as it should be, every conflict easily resolved.It’s all just so passable, a film that does enough to warrant a lazy afternoon watch but not enough to stick around in our memory for any longer. The formula is so well-trodden that it needed a sparkling jolt of energy to justify Penny traipsing his way through it again. Uncorked isn’t exactly corked but it’s definitely flat.;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
84;Mehdi Hasan: 'Most people ask the question and move on. I don't';"‘We all know that the president is a pathological liar,” Mehdi Hasan says from his office in Washington DC. “But the lies he’s been telling about the coronavirus – they’re no joke; they cost American lives. The US media’s failure to call Donald Trump out on those lies in real time makes part of the media, I’m sorry to say, partly complicit in those deaths, too.” Hasan, who moved from the UK to the US in 2015, is that rare species of TV interviewer: not in it to make friends, to network or to gain access. His passion for grilling his subjects is only matched by his frustration at his peers who do not do the same.When the White House press corps turned on the comedian Michelle Wolf after the 2018 White House correspondents’ dinner and defended Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, it was the last straw for him. In that moment, he realised that the US media is almost “irredeemable”.“If not now, when?” he asks. “If they’re not going to stand up against this administration’s secretary, then who?” A credulous New York Times headline in the wake of the 2019 El Paso shooting, “Trump Urges Unity vs Racism”, was, to him, just another stitch in the pattern of this submission. “The American press doesn’t want to rock the boat, and so things are just reported straight.”Such forthrightness has served Hasan well. Not only have his hard-hitting political interviews become regular viral hits, he has also become a fixture on the high-profile US cable news circuit. Rumours are beginning to circulate on the east coast about offers to host his own show on a US network. On such approaches he is coyly amused when I ask him, maintaining only that he very much loves his job at the moment.As an interviewer, he is relentless, a quality that boosted his profile after Trump came to office and the US media seemed unable to land a glove on the new president or his surrogates. As a columnist for the online magazine the Intercept and the host of UpFront and Head to Head on Al Jazeera English, Hasan has developed a reputation for somehow managing to nail dissimulating politicians by being forensic and refusing to move on until his point is made. His technique is simple. “Most people ask the question and move on whether they get an answer or not,” he says. “I don’t.”Hasan, 40, was already a successful journalist in the UK when he moved to the US to host an interview show for Al Jazeera English. An established pundit and political analyst with a diverse journalistic background, he has worked in TV at Sky News and Channel 4, co-authored a book about Ed Miliband, and served stints as the political editor of the New Statesman and political director of the Huffington Post UK. For all that it seems like a charmed career, Hasan describes it as “random”. He started out on the bottom rung as a freelance news assistant at ITN and puts his success down to those “willing to take a chance” on him.But it was in the US where he really began to cut through. Clips of his Al Jazeera English interviews began to catch fire online. A clash with the Trump adviser and Fox News regular Steven Rogers in November 2018 heralded Hasan’s arrival in the mainstream. In it, he questions Rogers on Trump’s lies on birth right citizenship, among other falsehoods. Rogers starts out with bluster before quickly squirming and deflating under Hasan’s barrage.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mehdi Hasan interviews Steven Rogers on Al Jazeera English. Photograph: Al JazeeraTo date, a clip of the interview in which Hasan pummels Rogers has had almost 8m views on Twitter alone. It brought him to the attention of Seth Myers, who, when interviewing Hasan, called the Rogers interrogation “the template for talking to people within the Trump-sphere”. Hasan has recently also developed a following among Hollywood stars with an activist bent. Mark Ruffalo tweeted the Rogers interview saying: “There is such thing as the truth, even today. This is how a journalist does their job to uncover it.”Hasan seems an unlikely figure to break America. And he has done it thanks to online word of mouth; shares, clicks and endorsements from high-profile figures. He is a practising Muslim and unabashedly leftwing. He is abrasive and pugilistic, with an endless appetite for Twitter beef that is often beneath him. He sees these “outsider” qualities, as he calls them, not as weaknesses but as strengths that enable him to transcend the pitfalls of a US news media paralysed by an old-fashioned courteousness towards those in political office.But despite the rough edges, he is a public school boy, and he admits that the confidence his private schooling and Oxford education (he studied that favourite of future prime ministers, Politics, Philosophy and Economics), has been invaluable in compensating for the fact that there are very few people like him in the British or US media. The “outsiderness” was from being a Muslim and the son of immigrants.He describes the household he grew up in as, although conventional, “disputatious”. And Hasan certainly enjoys sparring, but one gets the sense that it is not just this that holds the key to his interviewing technique. It is a lack of respect for power, for default authority, that animates him. “When I used to watch American TV religiously during the Bush and Obama years,” says Hasan, “I would joke about if you parachuted in a John Humphrys or a [Jeremy] Paxman, what would happen? The British press, the British media, for all its flaws, does not have this culture of deference when it comes to interviewing a person in power. I am amazed that the press stands up when the president enters the room. They don’t do that for Boris Johnson.”Even in the US, he says, the interviews that create a buzz are those by British interviewers: Emily Maitliss talking to Sean Spicer, or Andrew Neil to rightwing controversialist Ben Shapiro. “Shapiro lives on US TV, not just on Fox, on CNN, on Bill Maher and all sorts of shows. Why did it take Andrew Neil to come along and poke holes in the complete facade of Ben Shapiro? There’s a culture of deference not just to people in power, it’s the politeness. You have to get in people’s faces.”It is something he advises British journalists to do with Johnson, for whom Hasan interned at the Spectator, when the now prime minister was the magazine’s editor. He recalls a genial and polite Johnson, but remembers how the “untucking of the shirt and the ruffling of the hair” was clearly a deliberate act before meetings. While he does not believe that Johnson is as bad as Trump (who he says is “unique’ in his pathologies), he sees the danger of Johnson’s populism and the media’s complicity in both creating him and continuing to be soft on him. “I use the L-word, ‘lie’, I use the R-word, ‘racism’. In the Trump era, you have to be able to use these words. In the Brexit era, you have to be able to use these words. And there’s still a real shyness and reluctance for journalists to do that.”Facebook Twitter Pinterest The tables are turned … Hasan being interviewed on Late Night with Seth Meyers in 2018. Photograph: NBCU Photo Bank via Getty ImagesHasan’s righteousness is infectious, but it has not always served him well. A zealous address he made over a decade ago to a Muslim congregation in the UK has cast a long shadow. The remarks are recycled and used against him by his opponents on a regular basis. His observations, caught on camera, on non-Muslims (“cattle”), homosexuals and atheists, are hard to style out. He has addressed these comments often, most recently on Twitter, where he said: “Like a lot of journos (humans?) I’ve said things years ago that I now deeply regret.”When I ask him about this, he is prepared. “Dumb comments,” he says. But his contrition is laced with a defiance, because he believes that non-Muslims are not held to account in the same way. “Boris Johnson’s comments haven’t stopped him from being prime minister, ones he hasn’t even disowned. Why?” he asks. “Because I’m Muslim; there’s no debate about that.”His argument is borne out by an incident last July when Marco Rubio posted a clip of a 2018 Hasan interview with Ilhan Omar, aggressively edited to make her appear racist against white people. “It increases abuse and death threats to her, and to me. I wish I could switch off,” he says. The political climate in the US is one of constant threat to public figures such Omar and himself.Despite the prejudice and scrutiny that he says he and other Muslims and minorities in the public eye face, he sees a counterintuitive solidarity with Muslims developing in the US. Trump has been so nakedly Islamophobic and xenophobic that it has pushed “many people off the fence”, he thinks. The “silver lining” is that the open season on Muslims and immigrants has created a group of Trump’s opponents that is happy to support them. Hasan’s American experience is of a country that is becoming less Islamophobic and less anti-immigration, even as Trump’s Islamophobic rhetoric intensifies. He maintains that he has been embraced warmly by many in the US media, and is often asked for interview tips.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hasan on UpFront … ‘You have to get in people’s faces.’ Photograph: Al JazeeraWhen talking about this welcome, an earnestness and warmth creeps into his voice. Hasan has clearly been on a journey over the past few years, and when he talks about what really drives him, the professional interlocutor tenor, which sometimes feels like a hammer dropping relentlessly on an anvil, changes to a softer tone. “Fundamentally it’s about one thing, it’s about avoiding the dehumanisation of other people,” he says. “The No 1 issue in my lifetime right now is tribalism. I’m going to be there for human rights and civil rights. When I see the stuff I said in my 20s, across the board should I have been more careful? Yes. Because you cannot speak about people in sweeping terms. That is the No 1 lesson of life.”That, however, doesn’t mean he holds back on sweeping terms when criticising the rest of the US media. Despite his success, Hasan’s style of journalism is in the minority. The media “gave Trump a free pass in 2015”, he frets, and Trump’s ongoing bigotry is still treated with “both sides” equivocation. “My biggest worry, frustration, regret, annoyance, is that they don’t seem to have learned many lessons and we seem to be going down the same path for 2020.”The media’s handling of Trump during the Covid-19 pandemic has given Hasan little reassurance. “When the president turns up at the White House briefing room and falsely claims there’ll be 5m tests within a month or that Google will be involved in the testing or that people are being tested at airports coming into the country, isn’t it shameful that even now, no reporter stands up and says: ‘Mr President, why should we believe a damn word you say?’”";REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
85;Ridley Scott on coronavirus: Trump is a 'nutcase';The 82-year-old film director speaks out on the president’s handling of the crisis and says Boris Johnson should bring back rationingRidley Scott, the director of Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator and The Martian, has taken aim at Donald Trump and Boris Johnson over their leadership during the coronavirus pandemic.Speaking to Variety from his home in Los Angeles, Scott, 82, said he thought “this orange-headed fellow that’s running us” is “a nutcase, isn’t he”?Looking more widely, Scott suggested that half the world’s leaders were “idiots” and the other half “despots”. “There are very few worthwhile ones,” he said. “If anyone has half a brain, they wouldn’t want to go into politics anyway, right?”Scott, who was born shortly before the second world war, suggested that countries, the UK in particular, should reintroduce rationing because “people are buying so much food and then the food is rotting”.He continued: “Jesus, Boris, get out your thinking cap, cos what we’re now talking on is an iPhone: a perfect coupon distributor to limit what you can buy each time you go to the shops. And that way, you have order. You must have order and calm.”At the time of the shutdown, Scott was shooting The Last Duel, a drama set in medieval France, starring Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. He remains hopeful filming can resume later this year.Scott also said the disparity in the quality of coronavirus coverage across the US news networks was “insane”.“I still think CNN’s the best, and they are in dismay at how it’s not being handled properly.”Scott reiterated the advice for people to remain in their own homes, saying: “It’ll be an experience of mild to severe flu for most people and old geezers like me have gotta watch my back.”;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;Dua Lipa: Future Nostalgia review – a true pop visionary;Dua Lipa could have taken an easy path to sustaining her status as Britain’s most successful female pop star on album number two. A few Ed Sheeran co-writes, some savvy collaborations, 17 tracks (one for every Spotify genre playlist), a few on-trend lyrics about anxiety and skipping a party: deal sealed. But she’s done the complete opposite. The 11-track Future Nostalgia offers neither features nor filler, and makes a strident case for Lipa as a pop visionary, not a vessel.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Dua Lipa: Future Nostalgia album art work Photograph: APThe varying quality and sound of Lipa’s long-in-the-making debut was a real-time document of how modern pop stars have to evolve in public. Presumably emboldened by her success, on Future Nostalgia, Lipa sticks to the titular theme. Occasionally, too literally – the kitsch title track cites futurist American architect John Lautner, too arcane a reference for a pop song – but otherwise her fusion of disco and ruthlessly efficient contemporary pop is viscerally brilliant.She anchors these songs with snappy basslines, then makes them transcendent, fully conveying the transformative nature of the romance she’s singing about: Levitating blooms like a row of tropical flowers, while the chorus of Hallucinate, Lipa’s own I Feel Love, seems to enter an interstellar dimension. The references are adroit – Prince-like synth sparkle here, a Gloria Gaynor nod there, giddy INXS sample on Break My Heart – and informed: sounding like a darkwave Olivia Newton-John remix, Physical is ostensibly about sex, but it’s so urgent and almost militaristic, it recalls the role of dance music in the Aids crisis, when physicality became a political position.What Lipa’s powerful voice lacks in emotional nuance she makes up for with command: she never sounds like someone who’s “losing all my cool” (Cool), but she’s great at awestruck (Love Again), toxic allure (exes-with-benefits confession Good in Bed, which sounds oddly like early Lily Allen) and delicious spoken-word camp.The grandiose closer, Boys Will Be Boys, a lament over male violence, could have used more of the latter: Lipa’s point would be better made with Queen-like cheek, not an earnest kids’ choir, but her one-off impulse to Make A Statement is the only predictable 2020 pop move on an otherwise outlandishly great second album.;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
87;Star Trek: Picard is the dark reboot that boldly goes where nobody wanted it to;"Trek used to be a vision of an optimistic future, but there is a world of difference between the Amazon reboot and previous adventures of the EnterpriseIt is the year 2364, and Jean-Luc Picard – the revered captain of the USS Enterprise – has just come face to face with three humans who have been frozen in time since the late 20th century. By this point in the story – the 1988 finale of the first season of Star Trek: The Next Generation – he has met Klingons, Romulans, a pool of black goo, but nothing is as alien as these greedy, selfish relics.This is Star Trek, after all: the pop-culture behemoth built on the idealistic future envisioned in the 60s by its creator Gene Roddenberry. “A lot has changed in the past 300 years,” Picard tells them. “People are no longer obsessed with the accumulation of things. We’ve eliminated hunger, want, the need for possessions. We’ve grown out of our infancy.”Or have we? Revisiting the character 30 years later in Star Trek: Picard, Patrick Stewart’s grand return to the role at the age of 79, it seems the world has not progressed as much as we were led to believe. Set during a time in which the Federation – a union of planets with shared democratic values and interests – has turned isolationist in response to a terror attack, it has proved to be a divisively dark, gritty and morally bleak take on the Star Trek universe. Episode five opens with a beloved character screaming as his eye is ripped out of his skull. In another scene, a Starfleet admiral tells Picard – the great, heroic captain Picard, a man whose voice is built like a beautiful cathedral – to “shut the fuck up”.The reaction, understandably, has been mixed. Some fans welcome Star Trek being brought up to date with the look and feel of contemporary television. Others maintain that such pessimism is at odds with what makes Star Trek Star Trek. The showrunner Michael Chabon, responding to questions via his Instagram page, defended Picard against the latter claim by saying that “shadow defines light”, that “if nothing can rock the Federation’s perfection, then it’s just a magical land”. It is a sentiment that has been echoed in the past by Alex Kurtzman, the showrunner of the other ongoing series set in the same universe, Star Trek: Discovery. He justified its equally violent, profane and dark sensibility by maintaining that modern Star Trek is simply a reflection of its time.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Much too much? Watch the trailer for Star Trek: Picard.We live in an age defined by the post-truth possibilities of social media, the uncertain future of automation, rising inequality, increased rightwing populism, the spectre of climate change and, of course, the fact that we are living through a pandemic with the potential to be the most significant and traumatic period of our history since the second world war. Picard certainly reflects many of these concerns. It is little wonder that some of the most popular science-fiction TV of the last 20 years – from the technophobia of Black Mirror to the post-9/11 anxieties of Battlestar Galactica – is not exactly enthused about the future.Yet the idea that the grittiness of shows such as Picard makes it mature and relevant, while the ethos of yesteryear Star Trek is now naive or too old-fashioned to survive, feels misjudged. The hope, optimism and sincerity of the original 60s series was in itself a radical act: a way of portraying the future as it should be (a multiracial cast in a time of civil rights struggle; peace and cooperation in a time of nuclear terror), rather than merely wallowing in things as they were.In the 90s, the darker spin-off show Deep Space Nine pre-empted Picard’s themes by 27 years, asking what happens when the principles of the Federation are compromised by war. The difference was that Deep Space Nine, much like the best of Star Trek, managed to balance its meatier themes of PTSD, faith and wartime atrocities with episodes where everyone got dressed up to visit a holographic version of 60s Las Vegas.It is this, more than anything else, that is fundamentally lacking from modern Star Trek: a sense of tonal texture, a spirit of curiosity about different worlds and cultures, and the crackling chemistry of a warm and interesting crew. Instead, as is the case with Picard, its new characters have felt like broadly drawn “badasses” at best and, at worst, downright cold and unlikable. The prime example being Michelle Hurd’s new addition Raffi: the wise-cracking ex-Starfleet officer who insists on calling Picard “JL” (instead of Jean-Luc), and can often be seen vaping.Star Trek: Picard review – Patrick Stewart goes guerrilla in skintight velour Read moreThe limited length of the series, which – like so much streaming TV – plays out almost as one 10-hour story, is also a factor. The benefit of 20-odd-episode seasons in which a crew of characters is faced with a different problem every week lies not only in the soap opera-style comfort of coming to think of a crew as family, but also in the potential to experiment with a variety of different stories and themes. The focus of Picard and Discovery tends to be so narrow that the universe ends up feeling smaller, less alive and less interesting.And yet the appetite of modern audiences for that bygone era of Star Trek storytelling still exists. Just take the popularity of one of the strangest things on TV: The Orville. Originally trailed as Seth MacFarlane’s Family Guy-esque parody of Star Trek-style sci-fi, it has instead revealed itself as a trojan horse for his at-times entirely sincere Star Trek: The Next Generation fan-fiction, featuring MacFarlane cosplaying as the dashing captain of his very own Enterprise. Its aesthetics are similar, its stories are similar, it is clearly based around Roddenberry’s ethos of exploration and optimism. There are even episodes written and directed by 90s Star Trek writers and directors.As we all cower in our homes for fear of a threat that we cannot see, a dose of optimism about the future would be more appreciated than ever. But, sadly, all we are left with is a choice between Star Trek that doesn’t really feel like Star Trek at all, or a dodgy covers band playing the greatest hits. What a fate for a once-great franchise.";REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;Fiona Apple: where to start in her back catalogue;"The album to start withWhen the Pawn … (1999)Facebook Twitter Pinterest Fiona Apple: Limp – videoAfter writing her debut album, Tidal, when she was 17, Fiona Apple was painted as an ingenue – but she dispelled any impressions that she was an innocent just as fast as she emerged. As a classically trained pianist, her acerbic, sinewy songwriting nonetheless resists convention, pulling in off-kilter percussion and woodwind to explore the outer reaches of what might otherwise be reduced to “adult contemporary”. Her singular approach to rhythm and instrumentation sometimes verges on vaudeville. But she is best-loved for her lyrics (and her voice), betraying a self-knowledge – and sometimes a bitterness – beyond her years, and honesty sometimes to a fault. “When I have something to say, I’ll say it,” she has said.The unwieldy, 90-word title of When the Pawn … is infamous, but Apple’s second album is a perfectly-formed whole, running the gamut from rage to regret in just under 45 minutes. Produced by Jon Brion, with artwork and videos by Paul Thomas Anderson (Apple’s partner at the time), it featured Apple as sole songwriter on all 10 tracks, written following her fall from favour with the music industry. Two years earlier, she had accepted the prize for best new artist at the MTV Video Music awards with a controversial speech in which she expressed her ambivalence about celebrity and called “bullshit” on the entertainment industry as a whole. It came to define her, transforming her, in her words, from a “tragic waif ethereal victim” to a “brat bitch loose cannon”.With When the Pawn ..., she returned deliberately and defiantly, on her own terms. The lurching piano of opener On the Bound sets the tone, Apple breathing nimble smoke rings in the verse (“Hell don’t know my fury”) before erupting into flames with the chorus (“You’re all I need”). Through defiance (A Mistake, Limp) and desperation (To Your Love), she comes to something approaching acceptance with I Know, her voice bruised and beautiful over brushed drum and double bass.The three albums to check out nextTidal (1996)Facebook Twitter Pinterest Fiona Apple: Criminal – videoApple was 19 when she released her debut album, after a demo tape wound up in the hands of producer Andrew Slater via his babysitter; it went on to go triple platinum. She is still best known by many for the first single, Criminal – and the controversy surrounding her state of undress in its video. Apple wrote it in less than an hour at Sony’s request for a hit. But opener Sleep to Dream – with its slumping, tumbling percussion and shimmery strings – better represents her singular style, somewhere between piano ballad and R&B, with unflinching lyrical honesty to the fore. In 2010, proud Apple fan Kanye West identified the line, “I have never been so insulted in all my life” as his favourite first line of any song (though it is not, in fact, the first line).The Idler Wheel … (2012)Facebook Twitter Pinterest Fiona Apple: Every Single Night – videoApple met anticipation for her first new music in nearly a decade with her most stripped-back album yet: sparse and purposeful, with the electronic tilt to her past work notably absent. The Idler Wheel is almost a folk-country record, and finds the 34-year-old older, wiser and more ready to take responsibility for turbulence in her relationships than she had been in the past. “I could liken you to a shark the way you bit off my head / But then again, I was waving a bleeding old bone,” she admits on Werewolf, before concluding: “Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key.”Extraordinary Machine (2005)Facebook Twitter Pinterest Fiona Apple: Oh Sailor – videoAfter long delays, Apple’s third album made its inauspicious debut unfinished on file-sharing sites; it was officially released months later and named album of the year by many outlets. Co-producer Brian Kehew has said Apple’s lack of clear vision was one factor in the hold-up (along with a micromanaging record label
), and that comes across in the finished product. Extraordinary Machine is Apple’s most experimental record, as well as the most sonically rich – the opposite of what she would go on to achieve with The Idler Wheel seven years later. On Tymps (The Sick in the Head Song), every idiosyncrasy seems indulged, giving it the feel of a Disney soundtrack – or the Beatles at their most whimsical.One for the headsAcross the Universe (1998)Facebook Twitter Pinterest Fiona Apple: Across the Universe – videoThe most successful of Apple’s covers, of a stylish repertoire (mostly from live sets) taking in Sinatra and Hendrix, is her take on the Beatles’ Across the Universe, recorded for the Pleasantville soundtrack in 1998. Still her second-most-streamed track on Spotify behind Criminal, it is far from a deep cut, but her take on such a familiar (and – relatively for Apple – friendly) song foregrounds the molasses quality of her voice and her distinctive approach to instrumentation. The descending woodwinds after “nothing’s gonna change my world” are especially lovely.Further readingFiona: the caged bird sings, by Chris HeathChris Heath concluded his 1998 Rolling Stone profile, written in the thick of the fallout from the VMAs: “There is a long way to go in the Fiona Apple story.”Fiona Apple’s art of radical sensitivity, by Emily NussbaumMore than 20 years later, Emily Nussbaum picks up where Heath left off with her masterful profile of Apple at work in the New Yorker this month.Apple on griefApple’s moving letter to fans about the death of her dog, Janet, over which she cancelled a tour of South America, has been removed from Facebook, but is immortalised alongside Apple’s lyrics on Genius.Fiona Apple: six reasons she is the perfect artist for a time of crisis Read moreThe primer playlistFor Spotify users, listen below or click on the Spotify icon in the top right of the playlist; for Apple Music users, click here.• What are your favourite Fiona Apple tracks?

91;'$1,200 isn't enough': what a $2tn relief bill means for American workers;Labor advocates hail plan to expand weekly unemployment checks, but experts warn much more than $2tn is neededAdvocates for American workers praised a “historic” increase in unemployment benefits included in an emergency $2tn relief package approved by the US Senate, which will offer special “pandemic unemployment” to gig workers, self-employed workers, and some people forced to leave their jobs because of the coronavirus crisis.But although the unemployment payments will offer months of support to many vulnerable Americans, advocates said that the bill threatens to leave too many people out. Even $2tn in emergency aid, experts said, is probably too little for the size of the crisis.As part of the unprecedented relief package approved by the Senate on Wednesday night, millions of Americans would get an individual, $1,200 check to help them weather the economic crisis caused by the pandemic. The bill would also create a $500bn lending program for businesses, cities and states and a $367bn fund for small businesses, which would focus on helping small businesses to pay their employees’ salaries through the next weeks of pandemic-related shutdowns, rather than laying them off.US coronavirus stimulus checks: are you eligible and how much will you get? Read moreThe bill’s major benefit to American workers is not that single cash payment, but the sweeping expansion of unemployment benefits, labor experts said. The bill offers laid-off workers an additional $600 a week for four months and extends unemployment benefits to gig workers, independent contractors, and others who have not previously been eligible for unemployment, including people forced to leave their jobs to care for family members with coronavirus, or to care for children whose schools have closed.Despite some flaws, the emergency bill offers “the largest expansion of unemployment benefits in history”, Senator Bernie Sanders, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, said on Wednesday night before the bill’s passage. About $250bn in federal funds would go to expanding these benefits, Sanders said.For many workers, the $600 added to their weekly state unemployment checks would mean that the checks would come close to matching their original salaries, labor experts said, and the measure would increase most unemployment payments to around the median weekly income of $936.A worker who files for unemployment in New York, for example, would typically get just $435 a week. Under the new emergency relief bill, that amount would increase to $1,035 a week, said Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, a progressive thinktank. This was a “major boost of benefits”, he said, and would ensure that most workers filing for unemployment during the pandemic “don’t experience an economic catastrophe”.“These are, by historic standards, probably the most generous unemployment benefits we’ve given,” said Michael Madowitz, an economist at the Center for American Progress, a leading liberal thinktank.So generous, in fact, that a small group of Republican senators made a last-minute effort to try to change the benefits Wednesday night, arguing that the bill as written would temporarily give some laid-off workers benefits larger than their pay on the job.Senators Lindsey Graham, Ben Sasse, and Tim Scott called this a “strong incentive for employees to be laid off rather than going to work”.Sanders lambasted his Republican colleagues for trying to reduce unemployment benefits, an attempt which failed in the senate late Wednesday night.During “an unprecedented economic crisis”, Sanders said, “they’re very upset that someone who is making $10, $12 an hour might end up with a paycheck for four months more than they received last week.“How absurd and wrong is that?”Play Video 2:03 US Senate leaders reach deal on $2tn coronavirus aid – videoThe boost in unemployment insurance comes as the US labor department announced that 3.3 million Americans filed unemployment claims last week, the largest number the department had ever recorded. Millions more are expected to file for unemployment in the coming weeks. In California alone, more than a million people filed unemployment claims in recent weeks.The relief bill offers other lifelines to workers, including $367bn to help small businesses cover their employees’ salaries and keep afloat. An estimated 94% of Americans who file taxes will also get the one-time emergency payment: $1,200 for most individuals, $2,400 for couples, plus $500 per child in the household, with the payments reduced or eliminated for people at higher income levels.Most Americans will be able to receive these emergency payments through direct deposit in their bank accounts, and the payments will go out “within three weeks”, the US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said on Wednesday.Many could be left outExperts said that allowing self-employed and gig workers to receive unemployment checks was a crucial step forward, since these workers make up growing portion of the national workforce and have not previously been eligible for federal unemployment insurance.But the emergency relief bill still threatens to leave many people out, they said, including domestic workers paid in cash, undocumented workers, homeless Americans, people who do not have bank accounts, and some people who have not filed taxes recently.Even people who are eligible for unemployment may face delays in actually getting their checks. State unemployment systems have been overwhelmed by an unprecedented number of applicants. New York’s online unemployment application website reportedly crashed multiple times this week. So did Oregon’s.In addition, people who do not have direct deposit accounts on file, or who have moved since last filing their taxes, may face delays in getting their emergency payments. Some Americans who have not filed taxes recently may be entirely left out. The Internal Revenue Service estimates that about 30 to 40 million American adults, or about 15% of the population, do not file tax returns, Garrett Watson, an analyst at the conservative Tax Foundation, said.Some experts said there was also a more fundamental problem: even though the senate’s $2tn coronavirus package is being hailed as the largest emergency relief bill in American history, it may still not be enough to match the scale of the problem.The economy v our lives? It's a false choice – and a deeply stupid one Read moreDedicating roughly $350bn to small businesses for a paycheck protection program “sounds like a lot”, but the total cost of payroll alone for American small businesses is $1.5tn every three months, said Ernie Tedeschi, an economist who worked in the treasury department during the Obama administration.Offering loans to small businesses to help them cover a few weeks of employee payroll was good, Tedeschi said, but the amount in the current bill “is probably not going to be enough for a lot of small businesses to keep their lights on throughout the crisis”.The Senate bill includes funding that will allow the Federal Reserve to make trillions of dollars in loans to shore up the economy, Tedeschi said. Some of that money could also go to supporting small businesses, but it’s not clear how much. The Fed “has to divvy up that money in a lot of different ways”, Tedeschi said. “There are a lot of different fires to put out.”Political protestsExperts and advocates also said that a single direct payment of $1,200 for individual adults was unlikely to be enough to help Americans weather a crisis that has no clear end in sight.“$1,200 is the average rent for most Americans,” said Natalie Foster, the co-chair of the Economic Security Project, which advocates for a guaranteed income for all Americans. “This first check is eaten up, and what are they supposed to do after that?“It’s hard when you look at overall numbers to see how much is going to shoring up big corporations, compared to how little is going to Americans,” she added.While “$1,200 per adult is very meaningful, no matter who you are”, Tedeschi said, “it’s not going to be this ongoing safety net that is going to keep families afloat”.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Employees of Junior’s Restaurant in Brooklyn sort paychecks for fellow workers who are picking them up. Photograph: Mark Lennihan/APIf the crisis continues past the short term, “a one-time payment may not be sufficient,” said Watson, of the Tax Foundation.Some Democratic lawmakers had proposed making larger, more continuous direct payments to individual Americans, to provide support throughout the crisis.A group of progressive state Democratic lawmakers and other progressives led a rallying cry on Twitter on Wednesday, repeatedly sharing the same message: “$1,200 isn’t enough.” They pointed to the vast benefits the emergency bill offers to large corporations.Some libertarians took a similar view, arguing that individual direct payments in a crisis were more efficient, and would be more effective, than government welfare for big corporations.“Just ten years after the Tea Party movement, Republicans in Congress are defending a $500 billion corporate welfare fund for a select group of large companies,” Justin Amash, a Michigan congressman who left the Republican party in 2019 to become an independent, wrote on Twitter.He called the Senate compromise a “raw deal” for Americans and said bigger direct payments “would be far more helpful to the people”.“For $2 trillion,” he wrote on Twitter, the government could “give every family of four $7,000 per month for three months”.$2tn US coronavirus relief comes without climate stipulations Read moreThe New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said on Wednesday that the Senate’s compromise bill offered relief that would not come fast enough for most Americans: “I just don’t understand how it’s reasonable to expect what could be millions of people and small businesses, who suddenly had their incomes cut off, to pay rent, mortgages, & major bills on Apr 1st without any payment moratoriums or immediate relief,” she wrote on Twitter.Despite public objections from some House members, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said on Thursday that she was “certain” that the Senate bill would also pass the House and be signed into law by Donald Trump. But she also said that lawmakers would need to pass an additional round of legislation offering more aid to those who had been left out of the current plan. The current bill is “just not doing enough for state and local government”, she said. Future legislation should also include additional funding for food stamps, she said.Some labor experts and economists said they believed further emergency aid bills would be necessary unless the coronavirus pandemic is resolved in just a few weeks. State and local governments are likely to face their own financial crises in the next months, as unemployment insurance payments and other emergency payments soar.“It’s hard to believe this is going to be anywhere near enough,” Madowitz, the Center for American Progress economist, said. “While $2tn is a big number, it’s not going to last that long.”;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
92;US indicts Nicolás Maduro and other top Venezuelan leaders for drug trafficking;The US has charged the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, and 14 members of his inner circle with drug trafficking, “narco-terrorism”, corruption and money laundering, and offered a $15m reward for information leading to Maduro’s capture and prosecution.Unveiling the indictment, the attorney general, William Barr, said the Venezuelan leadership collaborated with a dissident faction of the former Colombian guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or Farc, operating on the Colombian-Venezuelan border, which Barr described as an “extremely violent terrorist organization”.“They’ve obtained the support of the Maduro regime, who is allowing them to use Venezuela as a safe haven from which they can continue to conduct their cocaine trafficking and their armed insurgency,” Barr said.Alongside Maduro, Venezuela’s vice-president for the economy, Venezuela’s defence minister, and the supreme court’s chief justice are among the list of 15 current and former officials who have been indicted.The state department announced a reward of $15m for “information related to” Maduro, and $10m each for information on Diosdado Cabello, the head of the national constituent assembly, and three others: Hugo Carvajal, former head of Venezuela’s military intelligence, Clíver Alcalá, a retired army major general, and Tareck Zaidan El Aissami Maddah, the country’s industry minister.In separate indictments, prosecutors in Miami charged the head of the Venezuelan supreme court, Maikel Moreno, with money laundering. And charges dating back to May 2019 were unsealed in Washington against the defence minister, Gen Vladimir Padrino, accused of permitting planes carrying drugs to transit Venezuelan airspace.Barr said that Venezuelan leaders and the Farc faction organised an “air bridge” from a Venezuelan airbase transporting cocaine to Central America and a sea route to the Caribbean.“We estimate that somewhere between 200 and 250 metric tons of cocaine are shipped out of Venezuela by these routes,” Barr said. “Those 250 metric tons equate to 30m lethal doses.Geoffrey Berman, US attorney for the southern district of New York said the accused called the operation the “cartel of the suns”.“The name they chose reflects the cartel’s identity and operations,” Berman said. “It is a direct reference to the sun-shaped stars that Venezuelan military officers wear on their uniforms.”Barr said the US would “explore all options” to put the accused Venezuelan leaders in custody. Almost all of them are still in Venezuela. Carvajal, the former intelligence chief, had been living in Spain but disappeared in November after a Spanish court approved a US request for extradition.Another of the accused, Clíver Alcalá, broke from the Maduro camp in 2013 and and has admitted to plotting to overthrow Maduro with a mercenary army based in Colombia.Reached by the Guardian in the Colombian city of Barranquilla where he still lives, Alcalá said he had been mistakenly accused.“The Colombian authorities know where I am. They know I’m at home, and have no plans to run away,” he said. “I support the indictments against the Maduro regime but I’m a false positive. I shouldn’t be included.”The charges portray Venezuelan drug smuggling as a major national security issue. The justice department statement on the indictments said: “Maduro and the other defendants expressly intended to flood the United States with cocaine in order to undermine the health and wellbeing of our nation. Maduro very deliberately deployed cocaine as a weapon.”But US data for 2018, which shows 210 tons of cocaine passing through Venezuela, shows that six times as much passed through Guatemala in the same period.“The evidence they point to against Maduro is thin, which suggests this is more about politics than about drugs,” said Geoff Ramsey, director of the Venezuela programme at the Washington Office on Latin America thinktank.“Venezuela’s nowhere close to a primary transit country for US-bound cocaine. If the US government wanted to address the flow of cocaine they’d focus on corruption in places like Honduras and Guatemala – both governments that the administration has coddled in recent years.”The charges torpedoed efforts to break a standoff between Maduro, supported by Russia and China, and the US-backed opposition leader, Juan Guaidó.On Thursday afternoon, Tarek William Saab, the prosecutor general and a close ally of Maduro, announced an investigation into Guaidó, Alcalá – the ex-general also indicted by the US – and a host of alleged co-conspirators.“Guaidó and his North American advisers planned to bathe Venezuela in blood,” Saab tweeted following the announcement.Just a day earlier, Maduro had extended an olive branch to his opponents because of the Covid-19 crisis.“I’m ready to meet with all sectors that want to talk about the coronavirus pandemic,” he said in a televised address on Wednesday.But that offer appeared to have been rescinded following the US charges.“From the US and Colombia they have conspired and given the order to fill Venezuela with violence,” Maduro tweeted on Thursday morning.“No negotiation is possible now,” said one source close to the US administration and the Venezuelan opposition. “There aren’t going to be elections, how could there be?”David Smilde, a Venezuela expert at Tulane University, said it would be “tragic” if the indictments stopped the Maduro government receiving international assistance during the coronavirus epidemic.He also added that the charges would make it harder for the US to force Maduro out.“These indictments seriously increase the exit costs for Maduro, Cabello and Moreno. It is hard to imagine Maduro being willing to do anything other than hunker down knowing he has a price on his head,” Smilde said. “These moves effectively ensure a longterm deadlock between the US and Venezuela, just as we have seen with Cuba.”It is not the first time the US has indicted an incumbent head of state in Latin America. The Panamanian dictator, Manuel Noriega, was charged with drugs offences in 1988, and a year later, US forces invaded Panama to arrest him.In October last year, the Honduran president, Juan Orlando Hernández, was named as a co-conspirator in a New York court in which convicted his brother Juan Antonio “Tony” Hernández, in a large-scale drug conspiracy case.The president, who is a close ally of the US administration, was not charged.;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
93;'I won't survive': Iranian scientist in US detention says Ice will let Covid-19 kill many;Although he was exonerated, Dr Sirous Asgari remains locked up and tells the Guardian ‘inhumane’ jail is denying detainees masks and hand sanitizerAn Iranian scientist who was exonerated in a US sanctions trial but remains jailed by immigration authorities said the conditions in detention were filthy and overcrowded – and officials were doing little to prevent a deadly coronavirus outbreak.Dr Sirous Asgari, a materials science and engineering professor, was acquitted in November on federal charges of stealing trade secrets related to his academic work with a university in Ohio. Although the US government lost its case on all charges, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has kept him indefinitely detained since the trial. Now he’s speaking out about the “inhumane” treatment that could cost him his life.Asgari, 59, told the Guardian that his Ice holding facility in Alexandria, Louisiana, had no basic cleaning practices in place and continued to bring in new detainees from across the country with no strategy to minimize the threat of Covid-19.In a phone call from the Alexandria Staging Facility (ASF), he said he believed the only safe option would be to shut down the facility due to the deplorable conditions. ASF is a 400-bed site where people are supposed to be detained for no more than 72 hours, typically a final stop before they are deported. But with Covid-19 travel restrictions and flight cancellations, Ice has been holding people for days on end in cramped bunkbeds alongside new arrivals who may have been exposed to the virus.Asgari arrived at ASF on 10 March and has been seeking to voluntarily “self deport” to Iran. Ice has refused to let him fly home or be temporarily released with his family in the US. He alleged:Detainees have no hand sanitizer, and the facility is not regularly cleaning bathrooms or sleeping areas. Asgari and a few other detainees have devised a schedule to try to clean surfaces themselves with the minimal soap available.Detainees lack access to masks. For two weeks, ASF also refused to let Asgari wear his own protective mask, which he brought with him to the facility, and it has refused to supply one, despite his history of serious respiratory problems.Detainees struggle to stay clean, and the facility has an awful stench. Because the facility is supposed to be temporary, there is no laundry available and detainees are stuck with the clothes they were wearing upon arrival, sometimes after long journeys.There are no physical distancing guidelines at the facility. It appears no procedures or practices have changed in response to Covid-19 since Asgari’s arrival, even as Louisiana state and federal officials have urged people to isolate.“The way Ice looks at these people is not like they are human beings, but are objects to get rid of,” said Asgari, a professor at the Sharif University of Technology, a public university in Tehran. “The way that they have been treating us is absolutely terrifying. I don’t think many people in the US know what is happening inside this black box.”Facebook Twitter Pinterest Dr Sirous Asgari, seen here in a family photo, was acquitted of stealing trade secrets but remains in detention. Photograph: Courtesy Asgari familyThe situation is particularly worrying for Asgari, who is at risk of getting pneumonia if an infection like Covid-19 reaches his lungs. Given the conditions at ASF and treatment of detainees, if he were to get coronavirus there, “I don’t think I would survive,” he said.US surpasses China for highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the world Read moreAdvocates said Asgari’s case was especially troubling given that there was no legal justification or logic to his continued detention. He arrived in the US in 2017 with his wife and with valid passports and visas but upon arrival discovered he was being prosecuted by the US government for alleged violations of sanctions law.Asgari, a father of three, has deep ties to the US. He completed his materials engineering PhD at Drexel University in Pennsylvania, and two of his children live in the US. But the FBI surveilled him and ultimately he was charged with fraud and trade secret theft relating to his work with a university in Ohio.During a long trial, Asgari won his case and was acquitted in November of 2019, with a judge ruling the government’s evidence was insufficient. But because the US had revoked his original visa, he was then taken into Ice custody and has remained imprisoned since. He has asked Ice to let him buy his own ticket back to Iran, but he has not been able to go before an immigration judge and has not been granted bond to at least wait in the US with his daughter.“It is so egregious. He didn’t do anything wrong,” said Mehrnoush Yazdanyar, an attorney and sanctions law expert who is helping Asgari’s family and facilitated the Guardian’s interview behind bars. “This is someone who is being unlawfully detained. Now if he gets corona, his chances of survival are slim to none.”The stakes of his case escalated dramatically after he was taken to ASF on 10 March, just as the coronavirus was officially declared a global pandemic. The professor said the conditions at the facility were unbearable for long-term stays. New detainees are brought in at all hours, meaning it’s impossible to get sleep in his pod, where there can be up to 100 people in bunk beds in a single room. He puts toilet paper in his ears but has struggled to get any rest and now has a sleep disorder.Asgari said there was not enough food. There is only one hot meal at 5pm and two smaller meals at breakfast and lunch, and no way to purchase any other food. There are six showers for his pod, and people have a hard time getting clean and can’t access clean clothes.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Detainees struggled to stay clean in the Ice facility, Asgari said. Photograph: Gregory Bull/APIn other detention centers and jails, detainees often have official paid jobs and shifts cleaning the facilities. But at ASF, Asgari said, there was no system in place: “They say cleaning is everybody’s responsibility … They do sanitization once in a while.”He said he had been trying to encourage others to help him clean on a schedule, and that sometimes they have Clorox in the bathroom, but that other times they have had to just use the foam soap from the showers.One of his biggest concerns, however, is that so many people continue to be brought in and mixed with the detainees already there, violating the most basic standards of social distancing. “They are downplaying it in this facility, that it is safe … But the circulation of people under this coronavirus outbreak is absolutely nonsense … Coronavirus is a viral bomb waiting to blow up here.”For reasons that are unclear, Ice transferred Asgari from ASF on Monday, took him out of state, then brought him back to the Louisiana facility two days later. When he returned, ASF finally let him use his own mask for the first time, Yazdanyar said.An Ice spokesman did not respond to specific questions about Asgari’s case or allegations but said in an email that no one in custody in Louisiana had tested positive for Covid-19 and that detainees were “provided appropriate soap and cleaning supplies”.He said Ice was conducting testing at Ice facilities and providing personal protective equipment in accordance with US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines, and that all individuals were screened upon arrival.Asgari said he was doing his best to help fellow detainees when he could: “I’m trying to comfort others.”First US immigration agency employees test positive for coronavirus Read moreIf Ice officials were forced to spend a few nights trying to sleep at the facility, “they would understand what an inhumane situation they have created,” he added.ASF must close to save lives, he said: “Instead of shutting down, they are doing business as usual … The process is overruling human rights ”Asgari said he struggled to comprehend the fact that he remained incarcerated months after his trial ended. “I am deeply hurt by the way I have been treated after I have been exonerated. Ice does not care about justice. Ice does not care about the constitution.”;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;$2tn US coronavirus relief comes without climate stipulations;Airlines get $60bn bailout, but Pelosi’s proposal on halving of emissions by 2050 not includedA $2tn US coronavirus relief package will dole out billions to struggling airlines and offer low-interest loans that fossil fuel companies could compete for – without requiring any action to stem the climate crisis.The legislation, passed by the Senate late on Wednesday, includes a $60bn bailout for airlines. Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democrat-controlled House, had proposed a requirement for airlines to cut their planet-warming emissions in half by 2050, but that provision is not in the bill.$1,200 stimulus checks for all? What to know about the US coronavirus bailout Read moreThe House is expected to vote on the package on Friday. It also includes nearly $500bn in lending authority that one environment group, Friends of the Earth, called a “corporate slush fund with insufficient guardrails to protect workers, taxpayers and the climate”.Congressional Republicans have accused Democrats of taking advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic to pursue climate policy. The Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said this week that Democrats were “bargaining as usual” with “counter-offers that demanded things like new emission standards or tax credits for solar panels”. Multiple Republican politicians tweeted accusing Democrats of trying to usher in a Green New Deal with massive climate spending during a crisis.In the end, the stimulus package focused on direct aid to individuals and the worst-hit industries, while setting climate considerations aside.Annie Petsonk, international counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, said that while the situation for airlines and their workers was dire, the industry should have had to commit to slashing emissions as a condition of the aid.“The provisions we were focused on simply would hold the airlines to what they already said they’re going to do,” Petsonk said. “People do not want to solve one crisis by making another crisis worse.” The 2008 auto industry bailout, in comparison, led to stricter rules for pollution from vehicle tailpipes.The bill, the third in a series of stimulus packages, offers virtually nothing to climate advocates, but it is not the last word. Scott Segal, a lawyer and lobbyist with the firm Bracewell LLC, which represents energy industry clients, said a fourth stimulus deal was likely to involve “significant discussions of green objectives”.“Was this a missed opportunity for climate? I think the answer to that is no,” Segal said. “This stimulus package was primarily about getting money into the hands of individual households and workers and in some service sectors that were particularly hurt.”Kevin Book, the managing director of ClearView Energy Partners, a research firm, said: “Congress is going to be making more deals, and as long as there is a deal to be made, Democrats have made clear what they want.”Democrats negotiated multiple measures meant to prevent abuse of the $500bn available in lending, including an oversight board, a special inspector general and provisions aimed at limiting Donald Trump’s businesses from benefiting – an issue that has already come under scrutiny.But climate hawks said those stipulations were not strong enough. “What makes this so frightening is that there are very few binding restrictions on how this money can be used that the secretary of treasury cannot waive,” said Lukas Ross, a senior policy analyst with Friends of the Earth.“It’s great that [Trump’s son-in-law ] Jared Kushner isn’t going to get a subsidised line of credit. It’s much more worrying in human terms that Chevron, Exxon and every other polluter you can imagine is eligible to be propped up in terms of the stimulus package.”The bill also does not include specific assistance to the renewable energy industry, although trade associations and lobbyists expect to revisit that possibility as discussions continue about more targeted aid for at-risk sectors of the economy.The American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) projects that the US wind industry could lose 35,000 jobs and $35bn in investment. Those losses could lead to lease payment and tax revenue reductions for local and state governments. No tax credit extensions have been granted for the solar and wind industries, meaning they may lose access to credits if they miss deadlines.“Obviously of primary importance is the public health and keeping the economy moving. We applaud that big effort,” said Tom Kiernan, the chief executive of the AWEA, adding that his group would continue to push for tax provisions to stem industry losses.The Solar Energy Industries Association said the solar sector could lose half its jobs, meaning “125,000 families who will no longer receive a paycheck”.Abigail Ross Hopper, its president and CEO, said: “Legislators were really focused on industry-wide protections and assistance, like the unemployment insurance, like the loans for which our companies are eligible, and did not include industry-specific solutions for a couple of particularly hard hit ones.”In one climate win for Democrats, the bill does not include a discussed $3bn to buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to lift global oil prices.;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;Fossil of 67m-year-old raptor dinosaur found in New Mexico;A meat-eating dinosaur with a feathered body, iron grip and a tail for agile pursuit of prey, has been discovered by fossil hunters, revealing that raptor dinosaurs were thriving right up to the point the asteroid struck, 66m years ago.The remains, comprising about 20 bones, were found in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico, in rocks dating to about 67m years ago. They are believed to be from a type of dromaeosaurid – a family of theropod dinosaurs that includes raptors – which appears to have been a close cousin of the velociraptor.Dubbed Dineobellator notohesperus – a nod to the indigenous people of the region, the Navajo, the latin word for warrior and the south-western US location it was found in – the animal would have been about two metres in length, weighed about 18-22kg, and been covered in feathers.Researchers say the fossils show a number of unusual features. “The upper arm bone has a very distinct angle in it, and basically what that means is that muscles attaching there would have been more efficient than other [dromaeosaurids],” said Dr Steven Jasinski, of the University of Pennsylvania and a co-author of the research.“[That] would have allowed muscles of a similar size to be stronger and do more work more quickly in this animal.”The animal’s claws also showed large projections on their bottom side, where muscles and tendons would have attached. “They are especially large, which would have given this animal a really strong grip and ability to grasp things with both its hands and feet,” said Jasinski.And while many dromaeosaurids had stiff, reinforced tails that acted as a counterbalance, helping the animals run fast while low to the ground, the newly discovered beast had an extra feature: mobility.“The one major thing that is different about Dineobellator is that at the base of the tail, the vertebrae are set up differently so it makes the tail highly mobile at the base,” said Jasinski. That, he added, means the dinosaur would have been able to whip its stiff tail around while pursing zig-zagging prey, meaning it was not only a nippy predator, but agile to boot.While the final moments of Dineobellator are lost to time, the team found a gouge in one of the animal’s claws that appears to have been made around the time of its death – suggesting the beast may have met a sticky end. “We speculate an altercation with another Dineobellator or other predatory theropod resulted in these marks,” they write.Jasinksi noted that while dromaeosaurids were present in both Asia and North America about 125m years ago, there are few fossils from the period that followed, with more recent remains discovered primarily in Asia.“It looks like the ancestors of Dineobellator would have basically migrated from Asia and then diversified once they got back to North America at the very end of the Cretaceous, right before they went extinct,” said Jasinski.Jasinski said the findings emphasised there was still considerable diversity before the mass extinction, despite some arguing that dinosaurs were in decline. “It shows dromeosaurids were still basically evolving, they were still trying out new evolutionary pathways, new features, up to the very end,” he said.Dr Stephen Brusatte, a palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the research, agreed, adding that Dineobellator is the best fossil raptor dinosaur from southern North America during the very end of the age of dinosaurs, and one of the last surviving raptors.“In fact, it seems like there were many types of raptors in North America at this time, so they were really prospering,” he said.The creature would have been fearsome, he added. “If you saw it alive, Dineobellator would have looked like a weird, long-tailed, toothy bird – but one that could chase you down on foot and gut you with its claws.”;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;Maryland HBCUs awarded half a billion in racial discrimination compensation;After ‘historic’ $577m settlement, historically black colleges and universities look to combat educational inequitiesMaryland has voted in favor of awarding four state universities more than half a billion dollars in compensation for years of institutional racial discrimination, signaling the end of a long legal battle.In a victory resulting from a lawsuit filed more than a decade ago, four historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) can expect a boost to their budgets of a total of $577m after the Maryland senate, in a rare legislative resolution to legal action, gave bipartisan support to a landmark settlement.“It’s been a long time coming,” said Michael Jones, partner with Kirkland & Ellis LLP and one of the lead attorneys with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. “We’ve had four failed mediations under two governors since 2013.“It was a historic moment. Listening to it was like listening to the passage of major civil rights legislation,” Jones added.In 2006, the Coalition for Equity and Excellence in Maryland Higher Education filed a lawsuit alleging the state deliberately duplicated innovative educational programs created at black universities, luring would-be students to their white counterparts.The coalition is composed of alumni of HBCUs. The more than 100 institutions were established before the Civil Rights Act of 1964, mostly in the latter 19th century, to serve African Americans who were barred from predominantly white schools.The suit alleged the state’s duplication of programs exacerbated HBCUs’ existing funding inequities.Earlier this month, the Maryland senate voted unanimously to pass the legislation authorizing the settlement, split between the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, as well as Bowie, Coppin and Morgan State Universities.A United Negro College Fund 2014 report found that these colleges produce more than 9,000 jobs, generating lifetime earnings of $95bn. They also have an estimated $1bn economic impact.What makes the lawsuit especially rare is for it to be resolved by legislation. Similar suits have been been litigated through the US justice department.Speaking at a committee hearing on the bill, the Maryland state house speaker and lead sponsor, Adrienne Jones, called it necessary to mitigate “lost time for tens of thousands of students waiting.“We [needed] to act now to level the playing field for all students regardless of background or race or college they attend,” she said.Mickey Burnim, interim president at Coppin State said at the hearing that the bill, known as HB1260, can begin to solve the problems discrimination has created.“HB1260 affords the unique opportunity to address decades of previous untraceable and traceable state-supported inequities and the unnecessary duplication in programs at HBCUs in the state,” he said.Attorney Michael Jones noted that African American consumers typically pay more in interest rates for mortgages, loans or cars” and that “societal challenges” add to what Maryland schools, HBCUs nationwide face “by virtue of being largely African American.“HBCU students pay more for student loans, and schools have to pay more for bond issues than non-HBCUs, particularly in the south, even accounting for various levels of credit worthiness,” he said.A bipartisan understanding of that legacy is credited with the bill’s unanimous passage. The Democratic state senator Obie Patterson told the Baltimore Sun he was inspired to see every Republican vote in support.“I have never been so pleased in all my life to see all green lights on that board,” he said. “We all can come together for a common cause and do what’s right.”The bill permits Maryland’s HBCUs to use the additional funding to establish new degree programs, recruit faculty and marketing contractors, and invest in scholarships and financial aid.Funding would be distributed proportional to enrollment at each institution.The bill now goes to the desk of the Republican governor ,Larry Hogan. His spokesperson confirmed he will give the legislative resolution consideration. Due to “overwhelming support”, the Morgan State president, David Kwabena Wilson, is optimistic the governor will sign the legislation.“It wasn’t passed with a razor-thin edge, it was almost unanimous if you take both houses of the legislature together,” he said.While the bill is veto-proof, if the HBCU coalition and the state cannot formally accept the legislated agreement by 1 December, it becomes null and void.The bill requires that attorney’s fees, about $22m, be paid through a mandated $10m increase for each campus in each fiscal year to help with long-term planning, scheduled to begin 2022.As HBCUs grapple with decreased federal funding and struggling endowments, Kristen Clarke, Lawyers’ Committee president and executive director, is confident in the precedent their settlement may have in addressing longstanding HBCU discrimination.“We hope that an ultimate victory here might provide a pathway that can open up opportunities to achieve greater equity for HBCUS in other parts of the country,” she said.;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97;FBI agents kill man allegedly plotting bomb attack on hospital amid coronavirus pandemic;FBI says Timothy Wilson, 36, had planned for several months to carry out a bombing and decided to target a Kansas City-area hospitalA man fatally injured by the FBI was planning a bomb attack on a medical facility in the Kansas City area, the agency said in a news release on Wednesday.Timothy Wilson, 36, was injured on Tuesday when FBI agents served a probable cause arrest warrant in Belton, Missouri, after a long-running domestic terrorism investigation, according to a statement on Wednesday from Timothy Langan, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Kansas City office.The statement did not detail what happened when agents served the warrant, but said Wilson was armed when he was injured and died later at a hospital.A months-long investigation determined that Wilson was a potentially violent extremist, motivated by religious, racial and anti-government beliefs, according to the statement. He had planned for several months to carry out a bombing and decided to target a Kansas City-area hospital using a “vehicle-borne” improvised explosive.Wilson chose a hospital that was providing critical care during the current coronavirus pandemic and had taken steps to acquire materials to build the bomb in an attempt to cause “severe harm and mass casualties”, according to the statement.The FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force kept close watch on Wilson and was prepared to arrest him when he tried to pick up what he thought was a bomb, although there was no bomb, the statement said. The FBI worked with federal prosecutors in the US attorneys office in Kansas City during the investigation.No further details were released.;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;Scientists find bug that feasts on toxic plastic;Bacterium is able to break down polyurethane, which is widely used but rarely recycledA bacterium that feeds on toxic plastic has been discovered by scientists. The bug not only breaks the plastic down but uses it as food to power the process.The bacterium, which was found at a waste site where plastic had been dumped, is the first that is known to attack polyurethane. Millions of tonnes of the plastic is produced every year to use in items such as sports shoes, nappies, kitchen sponges and as foam insulation, but it is mostly sent to landfill because it it too tough to recycle.When broken down it can release toxic and carcinogenic chemicals which would kill most bacteria, but the newly discovered strain is able to survive. While the research has identified the bug and some of its key characteristics, much work remains to be done before it can be used to treat large amounts of waste plastic.“These findings represent an important step in being able to reuse hard-to-recycle polyurethane products,” said Hermann Heipieper, at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ in Leipzig, Germany, who is one of the research team. He said it might be 10 years before the bacterium could be used at a large scale and that in the meantime it was vital to reduce the use of plastic that is hard to recycle and to cut the amount of plastic in the environment.More than 8bn tonnes of plastic has been produced since the 1950s and most has ended up polluting the world’s land and oceans, or in landfill dumps. Scientists say it threatens a “near permanent contamination of the natural environment”.The research, published in the journal Frontiers in Microbiology, identified a new strain of Pseudomonas bacteria, a family known for its ability to withstand harsh conditions, such as high temperatures and acidic environments.The researchers fed it key chemical components of polyurethane in the laboratory. “We found the bacteria can use these compounds as a sole source of carbon, nitrogen and energy,” Heipieper said.Fungi has been used before to break down polyurethane, but bacteria are much easier to harness for industrial use. Heipieper said the next step would be to identify the genes that code for the enzymes produced by the bug that break down the polyurethane.Scientists revealed in 2018 that they had accidentally created a mutant enzyme that breaks down plastic drinks bottles, which are made of PET, potentially enabling the complete recycling of bottles for the first time. One of the team behind this advance, Prof John McGeehan, the director of the Centre for Enzyme Innovation at the University of Portsmouth, England, praised the new work.“The breakdown of certain polyurethanes can release toxic additives, which need to be handled carefully. This research group has discovered a strain that can tackle some of these chemicals,” he said. “While there is still much work to be done, this is exciting and necessary research that demonstrates the power of looking to nature to find valuable biocatalysts. Understanding and harnessing such natural processes will open the door for innovative recycling solutions.”Heipieper said: “When you have huge amounts of plastic in the environment, that means there is a lot of carbon and there will be evolution to use this as food. Bacteria are there in huge numbers and their evolution is very fast.“However, this certainly doesn’t mean that the work of microbiologists can lead to a complete solution,” he said. “The main message should be to avoid plastic being released into the environment in the first place.”Previous research has also shown that some fungi can break down PET plastic, while wax moth larvae – usually bred as fish bait – can eat up polythene bags.;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;Hague court orders Dutch state to pay out over colonial massacres;"Indonesian man forced to watch his father’s execution is among those who will get compensationAn Indonesian man forced to watch his father’s summary execution by a Dutch soldier when he was 10 years old has spoken of his gratitude after a court in The Hague ordered the Dutch state to pay compensation to victims of colonial massacres in the 1940s.Andi Monji, 83, who travelled to the Netherlands to tell his story to the court, was awarded €10,000 (£9,000) while eight widows and three children of other executed men, mainly farmers, were awarded compensation of between €123.48 and €3,634 for loss of income.The cases concerned men killed by soldiers in the Indonesian province of South Sulawesi between December 1946 and April 1947 during so-called “cleansing actions” as the Dutch sought to repress moves towards independence.The court found that 11 men had been killed as a result of misbehaviour by Dutch soldiers, mostly by summary executions. One man was randomly shot.Monji’s father was executed on 28 January 1947 in the village of Suppa. More than 200 men are believed to have been executed by the Dutch military that day.Monji, who still lives in Suppa, said: “I’m grateful for the court’s ruling. I was 10 years old when I was forced to witness my father being executed by Dutch military after first being heavily beaten. I was crying.“I’m also grateful that I had the chance to travel to the Netherlands to attend the court hearing so I could explain the court what had happened.”Japan occupied the then Dutch colony of the Dutch East Indies during the second world war, and after its capitulation the nationalist leaders Sukarno and Hatta proclaimed the Republic of Indonesia on 17 August 1945.For the following four years, the Netherlands fought to prolong its 350 years of colonial rule of the country, often through barbaric means.The Dutch state had argued for the claims to be struck out given the time that had passed since the acts were committed.Relatives of Dutch colonial victims in Indonesia to get day in court Read moreLiesbeth Zegveld, the claimants’ lawyer, said: “We’re pleased with the ruling. It wasn’t easy; it took eight years of proceedings. It’s a pity that the Netherlands government hasn’t been more forthcoming, as many of our clients passed away during the proceedings.“Nevertheless, for those still alive and all the families, the court’s recognition of their suffering and their entitlement to compensation is important.”The court recognised in its ruling that the sums granted the relatives of victims were “disproportionate” to the suffering caused.";REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;'We fear, but have to work': isolation not an option for the poor of Nairobi;As coronavirus arrives in Kenya, retreat behind closed doors is only an alternative for those who can afford it'We fear, but have to work': isolation not an option for the poor of Nairobi'We fear, but have to work': isolation not an option for the poor of NairobiBenson Kinyale is a security guard who works the door at a luxury apartment complex in the Parklands neighbourhood of Nairobi. While residents of the building have started to hoard supplies and stay at home because of Covid-19, he continues to make the 80km commute by bus from his home outside the city, six days a week.He knows standing outside and opening doors all day is now a high-risk activity, as is travelling on a crowded matatu minibus almost every day. But he has little choice.“I know the virus is here. I wash my hands, but there’s no way I can stay home and quarantine, I don’t make enough,” says Kinyale. “I’m not worried yet, I’ll only stay home if it’s a real emergency.”Coronavirus cases have shot up in the past two weeks. On Thursday, one person had died from the virus and 31 cases had been officially recorded. The way people in Nairobi have reacted to the outbreak has thrown the country’s inequalities into sharp relief.A wave of the city’s sizeable expat community, from UN staff to NGO volunteers, have chosen to fly back to their home countries, often at the behest of their embassies. In attempt to beat the ban on international flights, which came into force on Wednesday, those without strong roots in Kenya packed up and left, regardless of astronomical price tags and 60-hour layovers.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Richer residents of Nairobi have stocked up on food and other supplies. Photograph: Duncan MooreFor those left behind, the Kenyan government has begun to roll out strict measures, at a pace far quicker than those in places such as the US. Within days of the first case, the border was closed, schools shut down and people encouraged to work from home. In the past week, bars have been shuttered, religious gatherings suspended and a nightly curfew imposed.The rich have begun to stock up on supplies and retreat behind gated compounds, with plans to work from home and rely on savings. Quarantining has started to become a facet of everyday life for those who can afford it.At the wholesale City Park produce market in Parklands, business seems to be continuing as usual. The only outlier is a new handwashing station set up by vendors.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Nice Wambui at her produce stand in City Park market. With too much in stock and not enough buyers, her primary concern right now is business rather than coronavirus. Photograph: Duncan MooreUnlike supermarkets in Europe and the US, there is still plenty in stock as many people can’t afford to panic-buy. But, says Nice Wambui, one of the many sellers in the sprawling marketplace, business has slowed and coronavirus precautions are the last thing on her mind.“I have too much stock and not enough customers,” says Wambui. “We fear, but we can’t stop working.”Next to the market a group of boda boda (motorbike) taxi drivers congregate on the corner, waiting for increasingly scarce customers. One of them, Fred Juma, echoes the sentiment.“Business is not normal, but we cannot live in quarantine. I have three children and a wife to feed. I’ve not thought about stopping, I depend on this job.”Juma is considering sending his children to stay with relatives outside the capital, near Lake Victoria, which will mean less mouths to feed. But only if the government declares a total lockdown. He’ll stay in Nairobi, since his extended family depend on him for money.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Fred Juma, centre, waits for business with fellow boda boda [motorbike] drivers in Nairobi. He has considered sending his family out of Nairobi but says he must remain in the city to work.Nowhere is this dilemma of balancing protection from the virus with earning money to feed families more apparent than in the Eastlands area of Nairobi, a collection of working class and poor neighbourhoods. Dandora is one of these, a patchwork of dense apartment blocks and informal settlements bordering the largest dumpsite in east Africa.While social events have been curtailed and schools closed, the streets are busy and almost everyone is still working or looking for opportunities to make money, including wastepickers who work in the dump site.Quarantine is considered a luxury, and while more people are avoiding contact and trying to wash their hands when extra water is available, hand sanitiser and face masks are out of reach for the majority of the population.One of the community leaders in this area is Charles Lukania, a local rapper and one of the leaders of Dandora Hip Hop City, a music collective that also acts as a community forum for young people, organising clean-ups and educating people about health and the environment.Lukania is concerned that unless the government gets its act together, neighbourhoods like his will be overwhelmed as the outbreak worsens.“The virus will spread faster because of the sanitation challenge,” he says. “And healthwise we don’t have much in terms of clinics. The situation was never good – lack of drugs, personnel, doctors. And that hasn’t changed with the pandemic.”Facebook Twitter Pinterest Charles Lukania, local musician and one of the leaders of the Dandora Hip Hop City group.'Community infections could happen any time': Kenya prepares for Covid-19 Read moreHowever, Lukania’s biggest concern is a lack of income, and therefore food, should the government make everyone stay at home. “Buying extra food is not happening … we live by the day.”Even though the government has introduced concrete measures to stop the virus from spreading, and tax cuts have been introduced, little has been set aside financially to provide aid to those in need.Lukania fears a repeat of the unrest that followed the 2008 elections, when the government imposed lockdowns due to ethnic violence. “If we lack food, people will start breaking into shops. After the elections people stayed home, two to three weeks with no work. They started looting, taking things. You had to move in groups for safety.”While he hopes things won’t get that serious, Lukania thinks the government needs to do more and prepare medical and food aid for a worst-case scenario. “[Right now], we are not even half way prepared to deal with this.”;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
101;UK-EU talks on post-Brexit relations 'in deep freeze';Planned negotiating rounds on the UK’s future relationship with the EU have been abandoned as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with Boris Johnson’s government still to table a comprehensive legal text for both sides to work on.During a European commission briefing on Thursday, envoys for the EU capitals were told that holding negotiations via video-conferencing had so far proved impossible.The two sides are trying to find a way to maintain dialogue in the coming weeks and months to kickstart the talks, but a previous schedule for negotiating rounds, with weeks set aside for consultation and preparation, has been ditched.The fact that the UK was still to table a legal text added an extra layer of difficulty, EU sources said.The European commission published a 441-page draft treaty on 13 March that covers every aspect of the future relationship. The UK left the EU on 31 January and has until the end of the year to negotiate a new economic and security relationship or face trading on WTO terms with large tariffs on goods.Despite Downing Street’s public insistence that a similarly comprehensive text would be tabled earlier this month, EU sources said the UK had tabled only four documents covering trade, transport, aviation and nuclear cooperation. London has not tabled legal text on significant issues including security cooperation or fisheries, and nor has it made its texts public.EU sources also said the UK’s positions in the texts were in a “different galaxy” to those of Brussels.“The first big difference is that we have a fully fledged proposal in line with the political declaration while the Brits have only tabled a few things, much less than we expected”, one senior EU diplomat said. “The scope is much narrower than we had thought it would have been and that makes it difficult to work with. That’s the basic problem.”Officials on both sides are also struggling to find a way to get negotiations going, with plans for talks in London and Brussels now abandoned given the Covid-19 crisis.UK officials said the legal text covering the outstanding areas would be produced at a time of the British government’s choosing, and attempts to find a new method of “continuous dialogue” were being made.EU sources said the position was desperate. “We can’t even move out of Brussels to our capitals to talk it through,” said one source. “Everything is in the deep freeze.”The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is in quarantine having been infected with the coronavirus. The UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, has been in isolation after showing symptoms.The two sides need to agree on whether or not to extend the transition period by “up to one or two years” before 1 July. Johnson has insisted the UK will leave the EU’s single market and customs union by the end of the year come what may.The former Brexit secretary David Davis has suggested in recent days that the coronavirus pandemic would limit the damage of failing to secure a deal because trade would already have been reduced to a minimum.The main sticking points between the UK and the EU remain on so-called level playing field commitments to ensure that both sides retain high standards in the fields of environmental, social and labour regulations. Brussels is seeking non-regression from EU standards and for the UK to “harmonise” with Brussels on state aid rules that limit subsidies.;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;G20 leaders issue pledge to do 'whatever it takes' on coronavirus;G20 leaders have committed to do “whatever it takes” to minimise the social and economic damage of the coronavirus pandemic, in a largely unspecific and uncontroversial joint communique issued after a video conference call.In a two-hour meeting the leaders agreed to assess gaps in pandemic preparedness and increase funding for research and development in vaccines and medicines, an area in which the G20 has shown an interest in the past.A call by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a doubling of its funding to $2tn was not addressed specifically in the communique. The statement said G20 members had undertaken a $5tn stimulus through targeted fiscal policy and insurance schemes, and members would look to increase funding to multilateral bodies as required. Central bank governors were urged to draw up an action plan in conjunction with finance ministers.G20 leaders, whose countries account for 80% of the world’s GDP, have been criticised for failing to produce a quick response to the pandemic of the quality of that in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash.Their summit was due to be followed by a virtual meeting of EU leaders, whose countries were rebuked on Thursday morning by the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, for “looking out for themselves” during the early phases of the crisis.Taking an unusually critical tone, von der Leyen said the story of the past few weeks had been partly a painful one. “When Europe really needed an all-for-one spirit, too many initially gave an only-for-me response.”She was referring to export bans on critical medical goods, as well as closures of borders, which have created delays in moving food and healthcare supplies around the bloc, especially in central Europe.An internal report by von der Leyen’s team lamented that transport had been paralysed by border closures, leading to lorries being stuck in queues at EU internal borders for 24 hours. So far only three countries have followed the commission’s advice to create “green lanes” with minimal checks to speed up traffic. An EU statement is due later on Thursday.The G20 communique said members were united in their response and they would use all available policy tools to minimise the economic and social damage, restore global growth, maintain market stability and strengthen resilience.In an assertion of the relevance of multilateralism, the communique said the pandemic was “a powerful reminder of our interconnectedness and vulnerabilities”, and the virus “respects no borders”.China’s president, Xi Jinping, locked in a growing propaganda battle with the US over the cause of the outbreak, focused in his remarks on US trade barriers rather than a domestic Chinese fiscal stimulus as the best route to growth. He urged G20 members to boost the world economy by cutting tariffs, removing barriers and facilitating the unfettered flow of trade.China’s economy ground to a halt in February as authorities shut factories and imposed drastic lockdowns. Since then it has started to recover, but that can only continue if western markets also bounce back.The communique committed to ensuring cross-border flow of vital medical supplies, agricultural products and other goods and services.

103;Cave find shows Neanderthals collected seafood, scientists say;"Neanderthals made extensive use of coastal environments, munching on fish, crabs and mussels, researchers have found, in the latest study to reveal similarities between modern humans and our big-browed cousins.Until now, many Neanderthal sites had shown only small-scale use of marine resources; for example, scattered shells. But now archaeologists have excavated a cave on the coast of Portugal and discovered a huge, structured deposit of remains, including from mussels and limpets, dating to between 106,000 and 86,000 years ago.Researchers say the discovery shows that Neanderthals systematically collected seafood: in some layers the density of shells was as high as 370kg per cubic metre. They say this is exciting because the use of marine resources on such a scale and in such a way had previously been thought to be a trait of anatomically modern humans.Facebook Twitter Pinterest The cave on the coast of Portugal that was found to contain evidence of Neanderthals’ use of food from the sea. Photograph: Zilhao et al./ScienceProf João Zilhão, of the University of Barcelona, a co-author of the report, said the discovery added to a growing body of research suggesting modern humans and Neanderthals were very similar.“I feel myself uncomfortable with the comparison between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, because the bottom line is Neanderthals were Homo sapiens too,” he said. “Not only was there extensive interbreeding, and such interbreeding was the norm and not the exception, but also in every single aspect of cognition and behaviour for which we have archaeological evidence, Neanderthals pass the sapiens test with outstanding marks.”The findings chime with recent evidence that Neanderthals had “surfers’ ear” and may have dived to collect shells for use as tools. Previous finds in Spain have shown they decorated seashells and were producing rock art 65,000 years ago.“Forget about this Hollywood-like image of the Neanderthal as this half-naked primitive that roamed the steppe tundra of northern Europe hunting for mammoths and other megafauna with poor and inefficient weapons,” said Zilhão. “The real Neanderthal is the Neanderthal who is in southern Europe.”The discovery appears to throws cold water on the idea that the marine-rich diet of modern humans, high in fatty acids, helped them to outcompete Neanderthals as a result of better cognition.“If [marine foods] were important to modern humans, then they were important for Neanderthals as well – or perhaps they did not have the importance people have been attributing to them,” said Zilhão, noting that in any case few modern humans were living by the coast.Writing in the journal Science, researchers reveal how the newly excavated site, which was about 2km or less from the coast when occupied by Neanderthals, contained a plethora of stone tools, roasted plant matter and remains from horses and deer, as well as from eels, sharks, seals, crabs and waterfowl, suggesting a diverse diet.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Shells found in the cave, the largest of which is 5cm across. Photograph: Zilhao et al./ScienceZilhão said the find also shed some light on Neanderthal fishing practices, noting that they must have had baskets or bags. “You cannot walk 2,000m with a catch of 10 or 20 kilos of shells in your hands,” he said, adding that the Neanderthal population also probably understood that shellfish collected at the wrong time could be toxic.The team say the dearth of other huge shell deposits in Europe could be down to a lack of preservation: shellfish could not be transported far from the coast, and hence many such deposits in northern Europe would have been destroyed as polar ice caps advanced, while elsewhere they may have been submerged as the sea rose to today’s levels.The stretch of Portuguese coast where the new find was made is perhaps the only location locally where such deposits could have been preserved, they say. South Africa, by contrast, experienced an uplift of the land, meaning many such deposits have been preserved.Dr Matthew Pope, a Neanderthal researcher at the UCL Institute of Archaeology who was not involved in the study, said its findings were significant.“We have increasingly recognised the sophistication of Neanderthal behaviour, but one thing that continued to mark out the behavioural evolution of modern humans in Africa was the appearance of systematic collection of marine resources, and this marked a difference between the two populations,” he said. “Evidence like this is important in showing Neanderthal populations had the capability for systematic exploitation of marine resources.”";REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;Ireland's old political rivals hold talks over historic coalition;The coronavirus crisis has spurred government formation talks in Ireland between Leo Varadkar’s ruling Fine Gael party and its old rival, Fianna Fáil.Both parties lost seats in a general election last month that marked a revolt against the political establishment, but parliamentary arithmetic and the coronavirus pandemic have prodded them towards an unprecedented coalition.After weeks of exploratory talks the two parties issued an agreed statement on Wednesday night that cited the need to form a strong, stable government to help Ireland recover from an emergency that is set to affect the health of thousands and plunge the economy into a deep recession.Irish banks told to offer relief to coronavirus-stricken borrowers Read more“They are working to develop a programme for government that provides stability and majority support in the Dáil,” the statement said, referring to the Irish parliament’s lower house.A coalition would mean Varadkar, currently caretaker taoiseach, would stay in power and rotate the office with Micheál Martin, the leader of Fianna Fáil, during an expected four- or five-year term.The two parties would still be short of a majority in the 160-seat chamber, so would need to bring onboard independent TDs (MPs), the Greens or small leftwing parties to form a ruling coalition – a courtship that could last weeks.Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, centrist rivals that have dominated Irish politics for a century, have ruled out a deal with Sinn Féin, which won a quarter of the vote in the 8 February election, making it the most popular party in a fractured political landscape.On Thursday, the Dáil met for 12 hours to debate emergency legislation on new measures to slow coronavirus contagion and to cushion workers, the self-employed, renters and companies from economic devastation.Varadkar said preparations for a no-deal Brexit had left Ireland better prepared for Covid-19, as some of the stark challenges facing the country came into focus on Thursday.Officials are working on establishing temporary morgues to deal with expected deaths, it emerged. “We are still in the preparation phase to deal with the surge when it comes,” Elizabeth Canavan, assistant secretary for social policy at the Department of the Taoiseach, told a press briefing.The Economic and Social Research Institute, a Dublin-based independent research organisation, said the economy could contract by more than 7% this year, and unemployment could jump to 18%, if restrictions to contain the pandemic remained in place for 12 weeks. Before the crisis, Ireland’s economy was the EU’s stellar performer and on track for 4% growth.The Republic of Ireland has recorded 1,564 cases of Covid-19 infection and nine deaths. Northern Ireland has reported 241 cases and 10 deaths.In the election, voters punished Varadkar and his party for a housing and healthcare crisis, but in recent weeks the taoiseach has won plaudits from across the political spectrum for his handling of coronavirus.;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;Benny Gantz elected Israeli speaker, signalling deal with Netanyahu;Israel’s main opposition party has split after its leader, Benny Gantz, was elected as speaker of parliament with the support of his rivals, including Benjamin Netanyahu, in a stunning plot twist to a year-long political crisis.Gantz’s move was widely interpreted as a precursor to a power-sharing deal with the prime minister to form an emergency government. The coronavirus pandemic, including more than 2,600 confirmed Israeli cases, has added urgency to efforts to break a stalemate between the two leaders.“These are unusual times and they call for unusual decisions. That’s why I intend to explore the formation of a national emergency government,” Gantz told the Knesset, Israel’s parliament.While neither side confirmed that an agreement was already in place, suggested scenarios have included Gantz and Netanyahu taking turns as prime minister in a rotation system.Whatever the outcome, Gantz took a risk by nominating himself for speaker, and he was accused of blindsiding allies and supporters in the process.Throughout three elections, the former head of the army has run campaigns squarely focused on promises to oust Netanyahu, who faces criminal charges for alleged corruption.Before the vote, Gantz’s public plans were to elect a speaker from his party and push through legislation to end Netanyahu’s historic political career through term limits and bans on prime ministers serving while under indictment.That plan appears to have been abandoned by the opposition leader in favour of the complete opposite – he may now, as speaker, protect Netanyahu from such legislation to keep the possibility of a unity government alive.However, in doing so, Gantz’s Blue and White party looks on the brink of disintegration, with factions within it refusing to back his candidacy for speaker, and several moving to break away.Both the Yesh Atid and Telem parties, which hold more than half of Blue and White’s seats, filed to leave the alliance.Yair Lapid, Gantz’s running mate and the head of Yesh Atid, accused the leader of surrendering “without a fight”.“Benny Gantz decided today to break apart Blue and White and crawl into Netanyahu’s government,” he said at a press conference on Thursday evening. “We ran together because Benny Gantz looked me in the eye and said we would never sit in this bad government.”Tamar Zandberg, a member of the leftwing Meretz party allied with Blue and White, accused Gantz of abandoning millions of voters who sought an alternative to Netanyahu.“You’ll end up a rug under the feet of an alleged crook, an inciter and racist,” she said in a speech to the session. “We are overwhelmed by the depth of the deceit and disgrace that has plagued today.”In his speech, Gantz said he would “never compromise on the principles underpinning the votes of over a million Israelis who voted for Blue and White. I will never compromise on democracy. Netanyahu is well aware of that.”While a unity government was not confirmed, a member of Netanyahu’s rightwing bloc, the defence minister Naftali Bennett, publicly congratulated Gantz for what he said was “the brave step of entering into a unity government under Netanyahu”.Israel’s previous speaker, Yuli Edelstein, was a close ally of Netanyahu and a member of Likud. He resigned on Wednesday following fierce criticism of his refusal to open parliament, which he suspended last week citing a ban of large gatherings while the country tackled the coronavirus.The suspension was decried as an anti-democratic attempt to shield his job and to protect Netanyahu from bills that could oust him.For the past year Israel has been in a state of political paralysis as a result of three inconclusive elections, the latest of which was held on 2 March. In that time both Netanyahu and Gantz have been picked to form governments and failed. Throughout the crisis, Netanyahu has remained interim prime minister.Gantz was the latest to be tasked with forming a government after gathering a loose coalition of anti-Netanyahu Knesset members to back his candidacy. However, it was not clear if he had the votes to build a solid, majority coalition by the mid-April deadline.Israel’s president, Reuven Rivlin, has been urging the two leaders to form a unity deal.;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106;Elizabeth Gilbert: ‘Don’t we all wish we’d written Wolf Hall?’;"The bestselling author on her love of Tove Jansson, trying to read Ulysses and why we shouldn’t ‘book-shame’The book I am currently readingI’ve just finished Boy Swallows Universe by Trent Dalton. It’s a novel about two resourceful and sensitive young brothers in Queensland in the 1980s, trying to survive drug wars, damaged parents, neglect, violence, supernatural encounters and love.The book that changed my lifeReading Rilke’s Letters to a Young Poet as a teenager was a thrilling and soul-shaping experience. He offers a dizzying mix of encouragement, faith and challenge – making me think I wasn’t completely delusional to want to live a creative life.The book I wish I’d writtenDon’t we all wish we’d written Wolf Hall?The book that influenced my writingWhen I was working on my first novel, 25 years ago, I was a short-story writer and a journalist who did not know how to write a long book. I could not figure out how one could sustain characters and narratives over such a vast expanse of pages. So I dug into David Copperfield and Bleak House, much the same way a little kid with a curiosity for mechanical objects might pull apart a radio transistor or a toaster, trying to figure out how the heck one of these things works. Dickens is so generous to his readers and so clear with his storylines; I couldn’t have had a better instructor.The book I think is most overratedHaving written Eat, Pray, Love, a book that many people think was overrated, I always politely eschew the “overrated” question. But the novel that I cannot believe isn’t more widely read is The Book of Strange New Things by Michel Faber.The book that changed my mindLayla Saad’s Me and White Supremacy was avital eye-opener. Because I didn’t grow up in affluence, I never thought the word “privilege” applied to me. And because I’ve always been very relaxed about identifying myself as “non-racist”, I believed that conversations about white supremacy had nothing to do with me. Saad’s book made me understand how I’ve been the beneficiary of centuries of white supremacy — and how I remain its beneficiary. She also gives useful guidance for fighting systemic injustice in order to become, as she beautifully puts it, a “good ancestor”.Let’s not book-shame ourselves, OK? Life is hard enough without piling on even more things to feel guilty aboutThe last book that made me cryMany books make me cry, but the last book that made me sob was A Three Dog Life by Abigail Thomas – a memoir about the author losing her husband slowly and over time, due to a traumatic brain injury. It’s a quiet and elegant book — not without humour, not with sensuality. And because Thomas writes with such restraint, the emotional impact of the loss sneaks up on you.The last book that made me laughPretend I’m Dead by Jen Beagin is a dark, twisted and hilarious novel about a young woman slumming about the American West, hiding from her life as best she can, while working as a cleaning lady. I barked aloud with laughter throughout the entire story.The book I couldn’t finishI wish everyone would stop telling me that I have to read Ulysses. The sad reality is that I simply cannot read Ulysses. I’ve tried. It’s hopeless. Stop bullying me, people. It’s not happening.The book I’m most ashamed not to have readLet’s not book-shame ourselves, OK? Life is hard enough without piling on even more things to feel guilty about. But let me just say this to the stack of unread (and undoubtedly wonderful and important) books next to my bed: I’ll get to you when I get to you. Be patient. Be even more patient. OK, let’s be honest, I’ll probably never get to you.My earliest reading memoryA magical volume called Great Swedish Fairy Tales, given to and my sister and me by my great-grandfather. I had that book memorised long before I could actually read it. I can still see the luminous illustrations of princesses, trolls, witches and handsome heroes on dappled horses.My comfort readThe Summer Book, by Tove Jansson. This slim, wise masterpiece tells the story of a tough and adventurous little girl and her equally tough and adventurous grandmother, who spend their summers together on an otherwise uninhabited island in the Gulf of Finland. It is a tale of feral females, at loose in nature and in love with each other. It is both unsentimental and heart-melting, and I read it every year.The book I give as a giftI have given away crates and crates of The Principles of Uncertainty by Maira Kalman. It’s a beautiful book, both as a physical object (Kalman’s illustrations are lush and magnificent) and as a study of how to live a rich and curious life, even in the face of terrible loss.";REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

108;Underground skyscrapers and off-grid bunkers: inside the world of preppers;From the mega-rich to ‘prepsteaders’, Bradley Garrett has spent the last four years with people preparing for the end of the world. What can they teach us about our current crisis?“Nothing sets your priorities straight better than a disaster,” says Bradley Garrett. “Making sure your basics are covered, making sure your loved ones are cared for. These are the things that matter. Going back to survival mode is a good thing … We’re going to be in lockdown for some months. But although the worst-case scenarios are terrifying, we will survive as a species. And we will learn.” A California geographer and urban explorer, Garrett has spent the past four years researching his book Bunker: Preparing for the End Times, which will be published in August. The research has involved hanging out with millenarian fruitcakes, disaster profiteers and the uber-rich, not to mention tooled-up, swivel-eyed anarcho-libertarians from America to Australia.Garrett became known in 2012 for climbing the Shard before it opened. As part of his ethnographical research into hidden aspects of cities he joined a group of trespassers called London Consolidation Crew. In 2014, he pleaded guilty to committing criminal damage during sorties into disused London Underground tunnels and published Explore Everything: Place-Hacking the City.The catalyst for his new book lies below Wiltshire. As part of his place-hacking adventures, Garrett had visited the Central Government War Headquarters, a 35-acre cold war bunker just outside Bath. The complex, called Burlington Bunker, under RAF Corsham, includes 60 miles of roads, 100,000 lights, sleeping quarters, a bomb-proof radio station, laundries, a drinking water reservoir, and a library from which Garrett nicked a few empty notebooks. “I kept the notebooks with me, waiting for a story worthy of them. I finally saw my chance in 2016, when the secret city was listed for sale, put on the market for £1.5m.” One of the prospective buyers was Robert Vicino, whom Garrett calls a doomsday realtor, and who markets bunkers to survive whatever apocalypse you might dread. “What these guys are selling is time,” Garrett says. “Yes, they’re selling space, but that’s the wrapper. The time to hunker down is really what’s on offer.”Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘We will survive as a species. And we will learn’ ... Bradley Garrett, author of the forthcoming Bunker: Preparing for the End Times. Photograph: Bill GreenGarrett met other dread merchants, including Larry Hall, a businessman who bought a 60-metre cold-war silo, designed to house nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles, for $300,000 in 2008. Hall transformed this Kansas facility into a 15-storey inverted skyscraper called Survival Condo, where up to 75 individuals can weather a maximum of five years inside. Half-floor apartments cost $1.5m, full-floor apartments $3m, while a 335-square-metre two-storey penthouse has sold for $4.5m. One resident made a year-long video film of the view from her Manhattan loft apartment over Central Park, during all four seasons, day and night, together with the cacophonous sounds of urban life. That film is now projected on to a wall of the silo, along with a mock-up of her balcony. The result? A Baudrillardian simulacrum to soothe her through five years in lockdown, while above ground presumably resembles a scene from The Walking Dead.In Bunker, Garrett discusses Navajo and Hopi cosmology, which posits that the era we live in now – the “Fourth World” – is likely to end as a result of human hubris. “Those Native Americans were on to something,” he says. But his sense is that disaster gives us an opportunity to rethink how we live. What will we learn? “That so much of what we do is bullshit. Work life destroys the planet because of travelling everywhere.” I suggest that he sounds like the anarchist anthropologist David Graeber, whose 2013 article “On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs” suggested many people spend their entire working lives performing tasks they believe to be unnecessary. “He’s right! I’ve got three plane tickets I’ve destroyed because I can’t travel. It’s so nice, really, not to go to the conferences. It’s great to recalibrate.”Facebook Twitter Pinterest Nuclear nightmare ... Burlington Bunker in Corsham, Wiltshire. Photograph: Bradley L GarrettWe’re doing this interview over Skype – me in London lockdown, he at his 78-year-old mother’s house in the hills above Los Angeles: he’s looking after her while she convalesces from surgery. “It’s in a gated community, which for a long time I’ve thought typifies social atomisation and despised. But I’ll tell you something – it gives me solace right now.”Garrett tells me that he began work on the book expecting to meet “the kind of people who are so rich that, after they’ve bought the second and third homes and the yacht they wonder what other real estate to buy. Hence bunkers.” But he also met people who regard survivalism as an antidote for an ailing species poised to plummet into an abyss of its own creation. Most are evangelical Christians. Among them are a group of women in Tennessee who live off-grid, crafting and repairing stuff rather than buying it. They, too, are readying themselves for the apocalypse, whether brought on by AI, nuclear catastrophe or Covid-19.There is a collective noun for all the people preparing for the end – preppers – and 1% of the United States population, or 3.7 million people, self-identify as such. Not that they form a homogeneous group. In fact the bunker crowd are despised by a sub-group called prepsteaders. “Stockpiling guns and food buckets is only going to get you so far,” Daisy Luther, the self-styled Organic Prepper, told Garrett. “Soon you’ll need people who know how to build things, grow things. We’ve all become consumers that don’t produce anything. We’ve got to flip that logic on its head.”Facebook Twitter Pinterest Disaster reading ... the library in Survival Condo, Kansas. Photograph: SurvivalCondo.comPreppers use acronyms that Garrett helpfully explains in his book’s glossary: they are, for instance, ready for TEOTWAWKI (The End of the World as We Know it). Many have packed Inch bags (I’m Never Coming Home), and believe that when the government isn’t providing essential services, it’s best to be a Yoyo (You’re on you own).Spending time with preppers has changed Garrett. He recently spent two months driving more than 11,000 miles across Australia in a Jeep Wrangler bug-out vehicle with his partner, Amanda, imagining the apocalypse. And now he’s ready to leave at a moment’s notice. “I always reverse my car into the garage,” he says. And instead of keeping his Inch bag under the bed, he has it – tent, basic supplies, stove, sleeping bag – stowed in the boot for a quick getaway. “Cities are not the place to be in extremis. When the shit goes down, better to be in Idaho.” He cites the French Marxist Paul Virilio, who worried that as space and distance were compressed by speed and connectivity, we would become more vulnerable to disaster. “In other words, progress and disaster go hand in hand,” Garrett explains.He also draws on the wisdom of Drew Miller, whom he interviewed for the book. Miller’s slogan is “prepare for the worst, enjoy the present” and the former USAF colonel’s business model involves constructing 12 survivalist encampments across the US, each for 50-500 people, and built to repel attacks by roaming post-apocalypse hordes. By buying into Miller’s scheme, for $1,000 a year, members can use the spaces to holiday, and then retreat to them as disaster strikes.Miller, whose staff call him Captain Paranoid, wrote the chillingly titled novel Rohan Nation: Reinventing America After the 2020 Collapse and published a paper arguing that cities are bad for you. Unlike “the largely rural, resilient population that weathered the 1918 flu pandemic … our urbanised society, dependent on electricity, daily deliveries of food… is a dependent population that may face both a much worse virus and economy in total collapse with widespread loss of law and order”. Garrett is sympathetic to such doom-mongering, writing in Bunker: “The 1918 Spanish flu pandemic alone infected 500 million people, killing off 3-5% of the world’s population. If such a pandemic tore through the world’s major cities today, spreading via international trips by plane and sea, we’d lose a lot more that 500 million people.”One thing that appeals to him about prepping is a newfound sense of agency. “We’re all familiar with dread, aren’t we? Well, dread is unbearable because it has no object, so you can’t do anything about it. Overcoming the dread is what it’s about. When we give shape to the things we dread, we make them manageable.” Having agency in the face of disaster is particularly appealing to Americans in 2020, he argues. Garrett grimly offers a reminder of the fact that Trump in 2018 dismantled the Obama-created National Security Council directorate charged with preparing for a pandemic. “When the government doesn’t prepare for emergencies, you do it yourself.”Facebook Twitter Pinterest Lunch buckets ... prepper long-term food storage. Photograph: Bradley L GarrettGarrett’s suggestion is that behind such ill-advised cutbacks lurks the uber-disruptor Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist. For Bannon, short-term disaster is to be welcomed, perhaps even provoked, since it can be used to leverage power. Garrett notes that Bannon would arrive for White House meetings with a book called The Fourth Turning under his arm. That book, by William Strauss and Neil Howe, proposed a cyclical understanding of history called generational theory, which holds that major events take place in 100-year cycles. Each cycle is made up of “seasons” lasting roughly 25 years: growth (The High), maturation (The Awakening), entropy (The Unravelling), and destruction (The Crisis). For the past 20 years, the US has been in entropy. But after entropy, narcissism and spiritual decay comes revivifying destruction. At least, so Bannon argued in his 2010 film Generation Zero.But if cultivating chaos for political ends sounds like a manifestation of American exeptionalism, Garrett suggests we should consider what happened in 2017 at a hotel in London. Bannon and Jacob Rees-Mogg met to discuss how to further the conservative cause in the UK. Garrett writes: “It seems no small coincidence that both men were the puppet masters behind what we might call ‘pro-collapse governments’ in both the US and UK. Leaders in these movements see chaos as an opportunity to seize wealth and power.”What’s more, Garrett reminds us, Rees-Mogg’s father, William, was one of the authors of the 1997 neoliberal text The Sovereign Individual: How to Survive and Thrive during the Collapse of the Welfare State, which opens with the quote “The future is disorder”, from Tom Stoppard’s play Arcadia and predicts that digital technology will make the world hugely more competitive, unequal and unstable.I suggest to Garrett that it is not only neoliberals who yearn for disorder to revolutionise the world but a certain type of Marxist, too. “Exactly. And prepping is caught in the middle of those narratives. On the one hand prepping is to do with living communally and on the other it’s shooting at people who want to get into your bunker.” As many businesses shut in the US last week, footage emerged on social media of long queues outside LA weapons stores as residents flocked to buy guns.For those of us without millions to sink into silos, there is an alternative. “Bloom where you’re planted,” Daisy Luther says. Sustainability, self-sufficiency and community, Garrett agrees, are the keys to survival. The lesson he takes from the preppers he met is that “disasters aren’t ends but irreversible transitions … They’re always something less than an extinction. Catastrophe, by its very nature, falls short of finality. It’s the end of something but never the end.”;REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;Miraa May: 'Women in music are sexualised so much. I find it disrespectful';"Miraa May’s pop preaches unshakeable self-love (“Tell ’em I don’t bow down to nobody,” goes one hook). But curled up on her sofa, bare-faced and dressed in black, the singer-songwriter says it is her way of putting on a front. “I don’t feel like I’m a confident person,” she says, clacking her pink, acrylic nails on her phone case. “I’m very insecure. A lot of women feel like that; that’s why they get into dire situations. They feel like they don’t deserve the best.

The 24-year-old’s summery, Afrobeats-tinged R&B tackles subjects such as consent (Make Room) and body positivity (Regardless) with the same natural, authentic passion as girls giving each other pep talks in a nightclub toilet. As a working-class, Muslim, Algerian-immigrant woman who grew up in Tottenham, her DIY attitude has more in common with grime artists from her area who worked their way up (like JME, who is “brotherly” to her, and features on her song Angles) than with her pop peers. She started making music at 17, juggling waitressing and cleaning jobs. After meeting a manager and signing a development deal, she took her first ever international flight to meet the producer Salaam Remi – known for his work with Amy Winehouse – in Miami. “It was really overwhelming,” she recalls. “Walking into a house with hella plaques everywhere ... You’re like: ‘What am I doing here?’”After the release of a soulful EP, N15, May lost her manager and had to return to work. But she kept writing songs, hiring her childhood best friend and flatmate as her new manager, and eventually “finessing” a deal with Island Records. She has dropped two irresistible EPs since then. Now, her debut album is “in its first trimester”.May herself is currently in her third trimester; her baby is due in May. “When I first got pregnant, I was like: ‘Is this gonna end my career?’” she reflects. Her team have been supportive, but after an Instagram commenter sexualised her under a post announcing her pregnancy, she felt more acutely than ever the pressure female pop artists are under. “The industry I work in, it’s full of men,” she says. “Women are sexualised so much. I find it intrusive and disrespectful. For me to do a show, I have to do my makeup, find a stylist. I can’t go and do a show like this,” – she gestures to her baggy Balenciaga T-shirt and tracksuit bottoms – “but every [male] rapper can.”Whether or not she is doing the singing, May’s voice is set to be heard in UK pop for years to come. She recently co-wrote the lilting Top 10 hit Be Honest for Jorja Smith. “My talent really is my pen,” she says. “I’ve never really cared about awards or statistics. I get messages from people every day saying that my music uplifts them; I’m good with that.”";REAL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

126;Contact the Guardian securely;If you lose your keys or forget your password, you won’t be able to read your own communication.Encrypted emails and documents are protected by both encryption keys and passwords. The bad guys would need to know both to read your stuff.If you plan to write an email to a Guardian journalist about a sensitive matter, look into PGP encryption. Used properly, PGP should make a message or document unreadable to anyone except the person who sent it and the person for whom it was encrypted. You will use a public key that belongs to the person you are writing to, but is freely available on the internet. This key turns your message into an unreadable jumble.

Do it on a computer that isn’t being monitored, and make sure the sign-up information you provide doesn’t tie the account back to you.If you’re using a browser-based service such as Gmail, Yahoo!

Two popular applications for encrypting text and documents, which you can then paste or attach to emails, are Gpg4win for Windows and GPGSuite for Mac.Once you have installed one of these tools you can use it to create your own PGP keys.

Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, the Services currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals. In the meantime, please see Online Tracking & Advertising for additional information about privacy choices that may be available to you with respect to targeted advertising.Data SecurityWe have in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect online.

Cookies are small files that are placed on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies may be used to store a unique identification number tied to your computer or device so that you can be recognized as the same user across one or more browsing sessions, and across one or more sites. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you do not have to enter those credentials each time you visit a ServiceCookies can help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because they help us see which pages and features visitors access and how much time they spend on the pages.

If you wish to disable cookies, refer to your browser help menu to learn how to disable cookies. If you disable browser cookies or flash cookies, it may interfere with the proper functioning of the Services.Beacons. We, along with third parties, also may use technologies called beacons (or “pixels”) that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device. We and third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.Local Storage & Other Tracking Technologies. We, along with third parties, may use other kinds of technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Services. We also may use unique identifiers associated with your device, such as mobile ad identifiers. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings. For HTML5 local storage, the method for disabling HTML5 will vary depending on your browser. For Flash cookies, information about disabling or deleting information contained in Flash cookies can be found here.Additional Choices With Respect To Targeted AdvertisingAs described above, we and third parties may use cookies and other tracking technologies to facilitate serving relevant ads to you. For example, these technologies help us determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before, tailor ads to you if you have visited our site before, and avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. You can learn more about certain types of targeted advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance website or our Ad Choices page.In addition to disabling cookies and other tracking technologies as described above, you may opt-out of receiving targeted advertising from participating ad networks, audience segment providers, ad serving vendors, and other service providers by visiting websites operated by the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance .Due to differences between using apps and websites on mobile devices, you may need to take additional steps to disable tracking technologies in mobile apps. Many mobile devices allow you to opt-out of targeted advertising for mobile apps using the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device. For more information, please check your mobile settings. You also may uninstall our apps using the standard uninstall process available on your mobile device or app marketplace.Please visit our Ad Choices page for additional information and privacy choices.Privacy Information for California ResidentsThe following information applies to California residents regarding “personal information” (as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)).
