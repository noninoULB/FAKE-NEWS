# FAKE-NEWS

## This repository is part of the first info-f422 project.
The .py files allow us to generate articles taken from the internet in  a CSV format. The outgoing file is fakegen.csv

In order to generate a new CSV file : 

 - Run the createcsv.py script
 - Run NewsScraper.py
 - Run NewsScraper.py again but comment line 23-24 (in order to have fake article)
 - Run fix.py to fix the csv file
